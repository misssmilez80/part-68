When they are forcefully parted, the film follows the extraordinary journey of the horse as he moves through the war, changing and inspiring the lives of all those he meets--British cavalry, German soldiers, and a French farmer and his granddaughter--before the story reaches its emotional climax in the heart of No Man's Land. The First World War is experienced through the journey of this horse--an odyssey of joy and sorrow, passionate friendship and high adventure. &quot;War Horse&quot; is one of the great stories of friendship and war-- a successful book, it was turned into a hugely successful international theatrical hit that is arriving on Broadway next year. It now comes to screen in an epic adaptation by one of the great directors in film history. \n\nGenre: Drama\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nCast: Emily Watson, David Thewlis, Peter Mullan, Niels Arestrup, Tom Hiddleston, Jeremy Irvine, Benedict Cumberbatch, Toby Kebbell\n\nWriters: Richard Curtis, Lee Hall\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nVideo: Xvid 1920x816 23.98fps\n\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 320kbps\n___________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:157c17b5e3cc69680266141ecb0dbcf8305e77d7","amp;dn":"War+Horse.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%5BHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"157c17b5e3cc69680266141ecb0dbcf8305e77d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,124,23,181,227,204,105,104,2,102,20,30,203,13,188,248,48,94,119,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
