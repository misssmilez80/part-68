Wim Wenders has made a perfect short about an open minded view on life where no one is a stranger in this roadmovie sliced from &quot;reality&quot;grey-skied German highways. It is also a perfect reminder of that an open mind can lead to so many great things or just a welcome break from everyday routines. The cast is excellent all the way from the distracted working mother to the hitch-hiking extras and as the &quot;bear&quot; we have an all time Wenders favourite -the man who's calm face in itself has a thousand stories to tell. Don't miss this little German gem, it's warmhearted and funny and you will definitely not forget it!
