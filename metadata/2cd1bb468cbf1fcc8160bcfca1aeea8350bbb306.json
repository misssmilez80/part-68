It was her marriage to Marvin that led Vickie to consider a career in music. She was asked to, and joined, Winans Part II, a group that included then in-laws BeBe and CeCe Winans and brother Daniel Winans. However, the group never took off as BeBe and CeCe left to join the PTL Singers of the long-running Christian television show, The PTL Club.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - July 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cd1bb468cbf1fcc8160bcfca1aeea8350bbb306","amp;dn":"Vickie+Winans+Discography+1985-2009+%285+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cd1bb468cbf1fcc8160bcfca1aeea8350bbb306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,209,187,70,140,191,31,204,129,96,188,252,161,174,234,131,80,187,179,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
