The International System of Units including, Metre Convention Treaty and its various organs including International National of Weights and Measure are described. The realisation of base units is given in detail. Classes of derived units within the SI, units permitted for time to come, units outside SI but used in special fields of measurements are described. Methods to express large numbers are explained in detail. Multiples and sub-multiples prefixes and their proper use are also given. The latest trends to redefine the base Kilogram, Ampere, Kelvin and Mole on existing base units of mass, electric current, temperature and amount of substance, in terms of a single parameter or fundamental constants are briefly described.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 176 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (November 19, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3642007376\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642007378","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df660bdee75e2daa4bc7cc98a1ca462eb397371b","amp;dn":"Units+of+Measurement+-+Past%2C+Present+and+Future%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df660bdee75e2daa4bc7cc98a1ca462eb397371b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,102,11,222,231,94,45,170,75,199,204,152,161,202,70,46,179,151,55,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
