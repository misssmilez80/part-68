Luckily you don't have to brave the classics in order to get a rich education of the ultimate warrior city-state of ancient Greece. \n\n\nPBS's The Spartans is a well-researched, well-paced three-hour documentary telling you everything an armchair Lambda-wearing Hoplite would ever want to know about Greece's legendary warriors. Classical historian Bettany Hughes does an amazing job of exploring all aspects of life and history in the utopian city-state, including their rise to power, battles, discipline and training, thrifty existence, ideals of equality, enforcement of social/sexual freedom for both genders, and, ultimately, their downfall. Couple The Spartans with Empires: The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization, and you are guaranteed to walk away knowing more than most about the roots of Western Civilization without having to crack open the classics .\n\n\n\n\n\n                            &quot; GO TELL THE SPARTANS &quot;\n                               STRANGER PASSING BY \n                              THAT HERE,OBEDIENT TO\n                                THEIR LAWS,WE LIE.\n                               \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Bettany Hughes\n============================\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................: The Spartans\nYear.................: 2004\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 00:54:16 (  ) 00:55:23 Each\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: (AC3) \nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 640x352 \nVIdeo Bitrate........: 1767 kbit/s ( ) 1803 kbits\n\n\nSubs.................: External English\nFile Size:...........: 701 MB\nFPS..................: 29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: April 27, 2004\nParts................: 3 Episodes\n\n\n \n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416424/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416424/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        **** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click \n\non DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s) \n\ninstead,thank you.\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c02a5e49f813830e65cf9ce3958f1cdda180b6ff","amp;dn":"The+Spartans-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c02a5e49f813830e65cf9ce3958f1cdda180b6ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,42,94,73,248,19,131,14,101,207,156,227,149,143,28,221,161,128,182,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
