She Allright Wit Me\n\n\nWith TRUE GRITS, the Deltamatics bring steamin' hot Mississippi summer days and sultry nightlife together for stripped down performances of all original Mississippi Blues material - written, recorded, and performed regularly across the Magnolia State - the Blues capital of the world.\n\nThe Deltmatics &amp; their TRUE GRITS were born out of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans, and the wild western coastal counties of southern Mississippi - turnip greens, crabs, catfish, \n\npigmeat, crawfish, and cornbread....hungry yet? TRUE GRITS gives a view into deep southern culture in the post-Katrina new millennium and takes folks on a culinary adventure with several songs paying homage to the soul food of Mississippi and south Louisiana. A couple of dishes that may be new to some listeners are introduced in Possum Blues....while Cathead Biscuits brings listeners up to snuff on where to to get stuffed in the deep south.\n\nThe Deltamatics are now based out of Hattiesburg, Mississippi where a southern downtown scene has flourished since Hurricane Katrina knocked the hell out of New Orleans and the Mississippi Coast. Lots of people wound up in Hattiesburg and some stuck around. One way or another, things picked up and the night life exploded in this old railroad town. Hub City Husltin' and Chocolate City give you a take on all that.\n\nFolks have embraced the Honest Downhome Grit of the Deltamatics.&quot;This music here is about being yourself and telling your story...&quot;These Mississippi boys do it right!So, check out the Grits and take the Blues tour from Memphis to the Hub City to the Big Easy and back. Get Wit Da Grits, Baby. Eat 'em up!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f9b4b6a629db5f1e70ef0198dd4703870d4861c","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+The+Deltamatics+-+True+Grits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f9b4b6a629db5f1e70ef0198dd4703870d4861c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,155,75,106,98,157,181,241,231,14,240,25,141,212,112,56,112,212,134,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
