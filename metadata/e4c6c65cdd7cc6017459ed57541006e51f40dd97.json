Cheers for reading this, this is the bit aboot series 2. Well, what have we no been up tae? Loads, but hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what happened in this series. For starters I thought it would be a good idea tae swap our seats on the flight home fae Afghan for tickets tae Shark World! VIPs and that - but the lads werenae intae it. Then there wis security for Barack Obama - which wis goinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ fine till a bunch ay pure rabbits turned up - nightmare! Then we auditioned for an advert that wis mental and I dinny want tae talk aboot it. Then the chef got sick cos he ate a peanut - how funny is that?! Then we lost a tank - kindae... then we scattered ma mum aboot a path! Sounds good? You bet your face it is!!! See ya!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4c6c65cdd7cc6017459ed57541006e51f40dd97","amp;dn":"Gary+Tank+Commander+-+Series+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4c6c65cdd7cc6017459ed57541006e51f40dd97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,198,198,92,221,124,198,1,116,89,237,87,84,16,6,229,31,64,221,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
