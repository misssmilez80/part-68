TKK's best and most hard to find album. This is a personal rip I did on an original CD.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. A Daisy Chain 4 Satan (Acid &amp; Flowers Mix) \n2. The Days Of Swine &amp; Roses \n3. Hand In Hand \n4. Waiting For Mommie \n5. Confessions Of A Knife (Theme Part I) \n6. Ride The Mindway \n7. Rivers Of Blood, Years Of Darkness \n8. Kooler Than Jesus (Electric Messiah Mix) \n9. Burning Dirt \n10. Confessions Of A Knife (Theme Part II) \n11. Do You Fear (The Inferno Express?) \n\nThis is by far TKK's best album, unfortunately none of their albums have a sound anywhere close to this.\n\nIf you like then seed so others can share this treasure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6f5f850759f01c0520983af7d45db0b6f82832e","amp;dn":"TKK+%7C+My+Life+with+the+thrill+kill+kult+%7C+confessions+of+a+knife","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6f5f850759f01c0520983af7d45db0b6f82832e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,245,248,80,117,159,1,192,82,9,131,175,125,69,219,11,111,130,131,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
