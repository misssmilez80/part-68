Disc 1 features the remastered original \nBlack Rose LP, and it sounds fantastic, very nice and dynamic, and you \ncan hear alot of the subtleties that were more or less buried in the \noriginal mix. Fine remaster. \n\nDisc 2 has an abundance of great material, including an unreleased track \nentitled Rock Your Love, which has been out on the net for quite some \ntime, but this one is vastly superior as it\\\\\\'s cleaned up significantly,\nsessions from 1978 in Nassau including an unreleased track entitled \nCold Black Night plus more, and a different version of Toughest Street-\nIn Town. \n\nIt features different lyrics and an overall different sound. \n__________\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
