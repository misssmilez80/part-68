They are handled by PR firlms, paid to do said \ntask. No studio would ever allow a screener of it's widely released film to go out incomplete. The fact that there's just a placeholder in place of the end credits tells you this. This might not be a DVD Screener, but it is the textbook definition of a workprint. It's incomplete in some ways, and not mastered at all. There are several video glitches throughout the film, one of which around one hour and 12 minutes, caused the already out of synch audio to go way out of synch. Though a small video chirp remains, the synch issues have been fixed. Had to split into several files, demux, synch and remux, then join the files back together. Corrected AR to original theatrical which was 2.35:1 I think it turned out pretty well. And, for a workprint, this is spectacular quality. This was also a phenomenal film, so if you haven't watched it yet, now is the time. \n\nSource: Other(Thanks)\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRespects to CaptainHomey, Cyanide, CM8, Rx, THC, ELEKTRI4KA, \nKillerhz, PA, YeFsTe, BoxSlots, MrRep and everyone in the struggle...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e8effb4314d311f65d020516ab590005a5b38a4","amp;dn":"Drive.2011.WORKPRiNT.READNFO.XviD-SiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e8effb4314d311f65d020516ab590005a5b38a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,142,255,180,49,77,49,31,101,208,32,81,106,181,144,0,90,91,56,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
