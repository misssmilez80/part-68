USA. The second civil war. The whole country is in a state of emergency. What was formerly called the American Congress now rules with fascistic methods. There is only one free city left, Steel Harbor, headquarter for the resistance. This is the hometown of Barb Wire, owner of the night club Hammerhead. As times aren't good, Barb has a second job. She's a bounty hunter and you probably wouldn't want her after you. Barb's credo is to never take sides for anybody and that's the only way to survive these days. As her former lover Axel Hood appears asking for a favour, Barb suddenly finds herself to be key player on high political stage. Now she has to take sides.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115624/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115624/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc6c92af3f31b53db597b483bc9aad2c3e79600e","amp;dn":"Barb+Wire+%281996%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc6c92af3f31b53db597b483bc9aad2c3e79600e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,108,146,175,63,49,181,61,181,151,180,131,188,154,173,44,62,121,96,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
