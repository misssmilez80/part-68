What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 9 - Sunday - After a trip to Kangaroo Island the contestants get back into the kitchen &amp; discover there is no Mystery Box. Instead they find themselves in an Invention Test with guest chef Heston Blumenthal.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d0a4d042126b25245160a9d12044fbcd93edbce","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E49.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d0a4d042126b25245160a9d12044fbcd93edbce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,10,77,4,33,38,178,82,69,22,10,157,18,4,79,188,217,62,219,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
