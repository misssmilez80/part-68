Willing to spare no expense, he instructs his representative to turn the dream into reality, an extraordinary feat that will require the involvement of Britain's leading fisheries expert who happens to think the project both absurd and unachievable. That is, until the Prime Minister's overzealous press secretary latches on to it as a 'good will' story. Now, this unlikely team will put it all on the line and embark on an upstream journey of faith and fish to prove the impossible, possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8c532f90ee518630323e5bde90c6215c5803682","amp;dn":"Salmon.Fishing.In.The.Yemen.2011.BluRay.576p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8c532f90ee518630323e5bde90c6215c5803682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,197,50,249,14,229,24,99,3,35,229,189,233,12,98,21,197,128,54,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
