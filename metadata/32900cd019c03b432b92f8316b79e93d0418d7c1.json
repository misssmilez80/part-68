WAGE LOVE or Be Dead.\n\nOK, stop BS'ing yourself. STOP IT.  NOW. \n\nI don't care who you are, what you look like, how much you make, what your education is or is not... if you are older than 10 years old, unless you are one of the 1 in 1,000,000 extremely humane then \n\nA.  You have chosen, CHOSEN the Matrix (meaningless intoxications of Head and Flesh), \n\nB. Your life centers on intoxications of the Head and Flesh (safety, security, physical health, status / superiority / domination (in whatever group), stuff, societal institutions, \n\nC. You are JOYLESS / Love-less, \n\nD. Your existance is Meaningless in terms of humanity and humanity's future - and you wonder why you are soooo frantic to feel aLive.  \n\nTHE FINAL FIGHT FOR LIFE-SUPPORT FOR SPACESHIP EARTH is The greatest reason in all of human history - TODAY - to move out of the Matrix and WAGE ALL OUT UNVIOLENT WAR. This entirely means leaving the Matrix - YOUR Head and Flesh being In Charge of you - For the Real World,  the ONLY Place Life Happens - OUTSIDE THE MATRIX - YOUR Heart being totally, completely, always in charge (YOUR conscience, Humanity, Courage, Compassion, Love (opposite of lust), vision, wisdom, Still-Small-Voice-Within).  'I will allow just one tyrant in my life; the still small voice within.' Gandhi.\n\nYes, being outside the Matrix, Living out of the Heart, instead Living out of the Head and Flesh - it looks like HELL to the onlookers.  Isn't that what the Life of Neo and crew looked like to the subhumanoid drones?  But did their Life feel like Hell to Neo, et al?   IT FELT LIKE LIFE, BECAUSE IT IS LIFE, AND NOTHING IN THE MATRIX IS. EVER.  AND THE HUMANOID DROIDS / DRONES / ZOMBIES ... dont know, and dont care.  DO YOU?\n\nOK, IT IS TIME FOR YOU, YOU, YOU - TO CHOSE THE RED PILL, OR THE BLUE PILL.\n\nTHIS IS NOT MAKE BELIEVE, but if you, and others don't choose correctly, SOON YOU'LL BEG FOR IT TO BE MAKE BELIEVE, BECAUSE IT it WILL BE HELL, FOREVER.  TRULY.\n\nYou have until the Nov. 2012 election to make this the Moon-shot moment for this generation - to reduce the use of Carbon 80% by 2012 - or it is game over - and Matrix for you forever.\n\nRed Pill?  Blue Pill?\n\n-------------\n\nThe Matrix is a 1999 science fiction-action film written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and Hugo Weaving. It was first released in North America on March 31, 1999, and in Australia on April 8, 1999, and is the first installment in the Matrix series of films, comic books, video games, and animation.\n\nThe film depicts a future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality created by sentient machines to pacify and subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Upon learning this, computer programmer &quot;Neo&quot; is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, involving other people who have been freed from the &quot;dream world&quot; and into reality.\n\nThe film contains many references to the cyberpunk and hacker subcultures; philosophical and religious ideas such as RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Descartes' evil genius, the Allegory of the Cave, the brain in a vat thought experiment; and homages to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Hong Kong action cinema, spaghetti westerns, dystopian fiction, and Japanese animation.\n\n\n--------------\n\n    dgr deep green resistance derrick jensen nonviolence global warming climate change lester brown plan b 3.0 bill mckibben james hansen joseph romm 350 ppm environmentalism green ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32900cd019c03b432b92f8316b79e93d0418d7c1","amp;dn":"The+Matrix+%281999%29+YOUR+Home+of+CHOICE.++STOP+IT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32900cd019c03b432b92f8316b79e93d0418d7c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,144,12,208,25,192,59,67,43,146,248,49,107,121,233,61,4,24,215,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
