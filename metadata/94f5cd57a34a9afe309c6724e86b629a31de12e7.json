When she was in law school she fell\nfor another student, Dex, who comes from an affluent\nfamily, but she was too shy to say anything. When Dex\nmeets her best friend Darcy, who sometimes treats her\nlike dirt, Darcy makes a move on Dex and gets him.\nEventually, they get engaged and Darcy asks Rachel to be\nher Maid of Honor. However, Rachel still has feelings\nfor Dex and still can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t say anything. Darcy throws her a\nbirthday party and Dex is there. When she and Dex are\nalone she blurts out that she had a thing for him in\ncollege which surprised him, and after drinking a little\nthey spend the night together. They try to forget the\nwhole thing and agree that it means nothing. Ethan,\nRachel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s close friend, tells her that she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll spend her\nentire life regretting that if she does nothing.\n\nRELEASE NOTES\n\nKiira Korpi ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94f5cd57a34a9afe309c6724e86b629a31de12e7","amp;dn":"Something.Borrowed.2011.NORDiC.PAL.DVDR-TXF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94f5cd57a34a9afe309c6724e86b629a31de12e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,245,205,87,163,74,154,254,48,156,103,36,232,107,98,154,49,222,18,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
