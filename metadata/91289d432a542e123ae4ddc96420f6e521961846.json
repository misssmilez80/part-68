Actually it's made by every single 2Pac song I have in my PC.\nSome songs were extracted from videos. There are various 320kbit songs.\nThere are both remixes and originals.\nThere are various songs with the same name - it's because one of them is BASS-optimized.\nThere are some remixes of Pac's songs that I thought were worth including in this collection.\nAs a fan of 2Pac I would suggest checking some T-Bizzy songs too (Never Change and some others) as the king of Rap/Hip-Hop is T-Bizzy's inspiration.\n\nEnjoy this collection and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91289d432a542e123ae4ddc96420f6e521961846","amp;dn":"2Pac+4+Life+Collection+%28M3+Software+-+a.k.a.+3ogdy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91289d432a542e123ae4ddc96420f6e521961846","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,40,157,67,42,84,46,18,58,228,221,201,100,32,246,229,33,150,24,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
