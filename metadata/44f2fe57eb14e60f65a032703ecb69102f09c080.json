Very old vhs copy of a 1995 tv movie, quality is not great but watchable.\n\n\n\nIn a distant future New York medical student Driscoll Rampart accomplishes his internship at Rusta, a rural planet that doesn't revolve around its axis and therefore is divided into contrasting halves of eternal day vs. eternal night. One is a Victorian-styled colony, the other a medieval kingdom. Both leave Rampart in a state of constant wonder, as he finds his way among humans and aliens, strange dreams and even stranger reality, a dark keep and a red sea, and more universal matters of war and peace, good and bad, love and hate and sickness and health.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44f2fe57eb14e60f65a032703ecb69102f09c080","amp;dn":"White+Dwarf+-+TV+Movie+1995","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44f2fe57eb14e60f65a032703ecb69102f09c080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,242,254,87,235,20,230,15,101,160,50,112,62,203,105,16,47,9,192,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
