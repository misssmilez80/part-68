In an attempt to secure a hold on 'Salesman of the Year',Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ Fitz takes a potential customer for a test drive and she winds up in a coma. The accident itself unleashes something in Fitz: the last unblemished corner of his damaged soul.  Larry (Ernie Grunwald) shows up on the Fitzpatrick lot intent on rehabilitating Fitz's battered psyche and the entire Fitz family's sleazy way of life.  This is not as easy as he'd hoped, as daily events include impromptu porn shoots, black market kidney trading, sniper shakedowns, cowboy themed bachelor parties, long nights in the drunk tank and more brain damaged sex than even Fitz can handle.  It's all in a day's work at Fitzpatrick Motors.\n\nIn the season 2 premiere Fitz' father has his annual prostate exam and instead the doctor believes he might have testicular cancer. A fortune-teller informs Fitz that he is cursed, that someone is trying to kill him, and that he needs to make amends to everyone he has wronged. Mr Fitzpatrick hires a new office manager.\n\nCAST : \nJason Priestley\t ...\tRichard Fitzpatrick\nErnie Grunwald\t ...\tLarry\nTracy Dawson  \t ...\tMeghan Fitzpatrick\nAmy Sloan      \t ...\tDot Foxley\n\n\nNOTES :\nThe first release had a pvr popup notice at 13.07.
