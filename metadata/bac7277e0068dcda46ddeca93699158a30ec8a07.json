Not\neven the heavily-armoured stegosaurus was safe from this killer, and incredible evidence\nreveals a glimpse of a vicious battle between these two giants.\n\nLife in Jurassic oceans was no easier; in 2008, a fossil was dug out of a frozen island high in\nthe Arctic. It was a colossal marine reptile, twice as big as most ocean predators, at 15\nmetres long and weighing about 45 tonnes. This was Predator X. Its skull alone was nearly\ntwice the size of a tyrannosaurus rex's, and its bite force unmatched by anything in the\nJurassic seas.\n\nThe balance of power between predator and prey is a fine one, as prey continually evolve\ndifferent ways to avoid predators. But for the most successful and enduring predators, the\nbattle to survive has always been tipped in their favour.\n\nJohn Hurt ...
