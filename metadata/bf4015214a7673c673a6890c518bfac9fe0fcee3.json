The sons share the same father, a womanizing drunk, but all have different mothers. Their father died a rich man and when they're brought together by their sister Nina to learn which of them will inherit the old man's fortune, they are handed an unpleasant surprise. A requirement of the will is that the three estranged siblings go into business together as bail bondsmen. Their first job is to bring in a parole violator who has left Leo with a $250,000 debt. Their search will take them into the mountains of Mexico where they encounter a drug lord and uncover a kidnapping plot, masterminded by an embittered entrepreneur that will endanger them all. \n\n\n\n\n\nExtra Info :\n- Movie Info.......: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1792543/\n- Genre............: Action | Drama\n- Cast.............: John Cena, Ethan Embry and Boyd Holbrook\n- Subitles.........: English\n- Subtitle Format..: .srt\n- Source...........: 1080p.BluRay-CHD\n- Format...........: MPEG-4 (.mp4)\n- File Size........: 1.46 GiB\n- Duration.........: 1h 36mn\n\nVideo Info :\n- Format/Info......: Advanced Video Codec\n- Format Profile...: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6c24050b042c2058425d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n- Bitrate..........: 1 848 Kbps\n- Resolution.......: 1280x688\n- Display..........: 1.860\n- Frame Rate.......: 23.976 fps\n- Bit depth........: 8 bits\n- Quality Factor...: 0.088\n- Writing library..: x264 core 119 r2106 07efeb4\n\n\n* What is DXVA?\nDXVA, or DirectX Video Accelleration, is a system built into Windows operating systems\nsince Windows XP that allows programs, if they support it, to offload the decoding of\ncertain media codecs to the GPU.
