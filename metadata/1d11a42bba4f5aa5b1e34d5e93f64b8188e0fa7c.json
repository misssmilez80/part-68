NOT ME\nSo i either inserted random audio at the parts that needed no explanation and for that robot fighting scenes i made a audio looping from the fighting scene itself. basically the audio at that parts is only plonking metal at each other, so you shouldnt notice that major, the audio comes right back in when there is voice.\nIn the end i just fixed minor sync issues that were either there or due to syncing, all in all very watchable.\nit wont get better than that and you can at least enjoy a full movie.\nenjoy\n\nVideo: 720x304 @bitrate 1600 2pass\nAudio: English AC3 2.0 Stereo\nSample: yes included\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433035/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433035/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : Real.Steel.2011.TS.FULLVIDEO.XviD.AC3.HQ.Hive-CM8.avi\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 1.51 GiB\nDuration : 1h 55mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 865 Kbps\nWriting application : Nandub v1.0rc2\nWriting library : Nandub build 1853/release\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 2\nFormat settings, QPel : Yes\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 55mn\nBit rate : 1 600 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.35:1\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.292\nStream size : 1.30 GiB (86%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 1h 55mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nDelay relative to video : 28ms\nStream size : 212 MiB (14%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\n\nPlot:\n\nSet in the near future, where robot boxing is a top sport, a struggling promoter feels he's found a champion in a discarded robot.
