Live actions, heavy bombing, mind blowing color productions, top to bottom throw ups, all on those infamous red steel trains that was an object of desire for generations of writers worldwide. With recordings dating back from 1999 and to the end of the era in 2007 COPENHAGEN TRAINS - VANDAL TACTICS gives an exclusive and highly aesthetic presentation of the true train writing spirit of Copenhagen. \n\nAll scenes are accompanied by an original soundtrack, composed and executed to the fullest by the Copenhagen Trains crew.
