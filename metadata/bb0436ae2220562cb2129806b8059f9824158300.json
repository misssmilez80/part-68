He arrives just in time to watch her douse herself in gasoline and set herself aflame. The next day he is called to a beach where SwedenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s former Minister of Justice has been axed to death and scalped. The murder has the obvious markings of a demented serial killer, and Wallander is frantic to find him before he strikes again. But his investigation is beset with a handful of obstaclesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a department distracted by the threat of impending cutbacks and the frivolity of World Cup soccer, a tenuous long-distance relationship with a murdered policemanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s widow, and the unshakably haunting preoccupation with the young girl who set herself on fire. Fascinating and astute, Sidetracked is a compelling mystery enhanced by keen social awareness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb0436ae2220562cb2129806b8059f9824158300","amp;dn":"Sidetracked+%28Wallander+%235%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb0436ae2220562cb2129806b8059f9824158300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,4,54,174,34,32,86,44,178,18,152,6,184,5,159,152,36,21,131,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
