We are out of Hartland, MI, a band called Mizmazduh. You could say this was our first EP. Recorded in Winter 2011 - early spring 2012. Our band's members have changed since then and we are a different group now, performing under the same name.\n\n1 - &quot;Paris on a Paper Plate&quot; [27.36] (Barbee, Oxley, Ward) \n2 - &quot;Aspirations&quot; [4.37] (Gess, Ward) \n3 - &quot;I Get Sleep When I'm Bored&quot; [30.56] (Gess, Gogiashvili, Oxley, Ward)\n\nDespite this record being called &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, it is no such thing.\n\nTracks One and Three are long, completely spontaneous jam-wankery. Tedious at parts, bizarre at parts, boring at parts, kickass at parts I think honestly. Track Two is a cover of The Bicycle Thief song of the same name.\n\nGood music to blaze/trip trip.\n\nWhy are we distributing our music for free?\n\nCuz we can\n\n\n\nNamaste\n\n6/30/12","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a075514d0fa018d7902c003d0cf1032475e5cd2e","amp;dn":"Mizmazduh+-+Greatest+Hits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a075514d0fa018d7902c003d0cf1032475e5cd2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,117,81,77,15,160,24,215,144,44,0,61,12,241,3,36,117,229,205,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
