Until recently it was assumed that it was largely restricted to southern France and northern Iberia, although in recent years new discoveries have demonstrated that it originally had a much wider distribution. The discovery in 2003 of the UK's first examples of cave art, in two caves at Creswell Crags on the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire border, was the most surprising illustration of this. The discoverers (the editors of the book) brought together in 2004 a number of Palaeolithic archaeologists and rock art specialists from across the world to study the Creswell art and debate its significance, and its similarities and contrasts with contemporary Late Pleistocene (&quot;Ice Age&quot;) art on the Continent. This comprehensively illustrated book presents the Creswell art itself, the archaeology of the caves and the region, and the wider context of the Upper Palaeolithic era in Britain, as well as a number of up-to-date studies of Palaeolithic cave art in Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy which serve to contextualize the British examples.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 300 pages\n    * Publisher: Oxford University Press, USA (May 24, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 019929917X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0199299171","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f74bf1c289773eb0f86376acab15d5d20c5ceb1","amp;dn":"Palaeolithic+Cave+Art+at+Creswell+Crags+in+European+Context%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f74bf1c289773eb0f86376acab15d5d20c5ceb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,116,191,28,40,151,115,235,15,134,55,106,202,177,93,93,32,197,206,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
