Travelling the famous Route 66 from the mid-West to the Pacific Coast, Melvyn Bragg assesses how relevant Steinbeck's work is today. He visits the site of the 1930s dust bowl in Oklahoma; the California orchards where bloody political battles were fought beween migrant labourers and growers; and the Monterey coastline where Steinbeck developed his ideas on ecology. Melvyn Bragg makes a case for Steinbeck as one of the great voices of American literature.\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (720x400)\nVCodec: XviD (2 pass MPEG)\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 720*400\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39ae82ce2e920f8d23f6f608e93e4fc8ce0cb088","amp;dn":"BBC+-+John+Steinbeck_+Voice+of+America+XviD+AC3+AUDIO-REMUX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39ae82ce2e920f8d23f6f608e93e4fc8ce0cb088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,174,130,206,46,146,15,141,35,246,246,8,233,62,79,200,206,12,176,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
