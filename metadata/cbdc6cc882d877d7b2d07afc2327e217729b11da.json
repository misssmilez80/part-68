With a plot similar to screwball comedies of the period, Carefree is the shortest of the Astaire-Rogers films, featuring only four musical numbers. Carefree is often remembered as the film in which Astaire and Rogers shared a long on-screen kiss at the conclusion of their dance to &quot;I Used to Be Color Blind,&quot; all previous kisses having been either quick pecks or simply implied.\nCarefree was a reunion for the Astaire and Rogers after a brief hiatus following Shall We Dance. The next film in the series, The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939), would be their final RKO film together, although they would reunite in 1949 for MGM's The Barkleys of Broadway.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbdc6cc882d877d7b2d07afc2327e217729b11da","amp;dn":"Carefree","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbdc6cc882d877d7b2d07afc2327e217729b11da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,220,108,200,130,216,119,215,178,208,122,252,35,39,226,23,114,155,17,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
