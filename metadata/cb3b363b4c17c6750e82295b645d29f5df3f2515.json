Written by Doris Lessing; Full-cast dramatisation starring Alison Pettitt, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Miles Anderson, Andrew Scott and Nicholas Beveney; Dramatised by Tina Pepler.\n\nA white farmer, Dick Turner, is passionate about his land; however, his wife Mary is utterly fatigued and frustrated by the relentless heat and grinding poverty. Her thoughts often drift to her previous existence in town, where she enjoyed a career and an active social life.\n\nMary becomes increasingly discontented, particularly when she realizes that Dick is, fundamentally, incompetent. Much of her aggression is taken out on a succession of black servants, who find it impossible to satisfy her demands.\n\nEventually she develops an obsession with a houseboy called Moses, and a tragedy unfolds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb3b363b4c17c6750e82295b645d29f5df3f2515","amp;dn":"Doris+Lessing+-+The+Grass+is+Singing+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb3b363b4c17c6750e82295b645d29f5df3f2515","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,59,54,59,76,23,198,117,14,130,41,91,100,93,41,245,223,63,37,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
