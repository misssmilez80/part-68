Carter, the father, is a typical superhero named Archetype, with strength and flight. Calista, the mother, fights vampires and other supernatural menaces. Cris, the daughter, through a portal in the basement, visits a sword and sorcery land to become the warrior princess Eradika and lead her forces into and out of battles. Clifford, the 10-year-old son, disgruntled, becomes involved with a small alien force. Eventually, all four aspects of their secretive lives come crashing together, sometimes literally, endangering many.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc8cac0862c573e0750ffa305ea5c96328df9db","amp;dn":"The+Crossovers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc8cac0862c573e0750ffa305ea5c96328df9db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,200,202,192,134,44,87,62,7,80,255,163,5,234,92,150,50,141,249,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
