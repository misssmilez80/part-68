Today, these trends have reached their extremeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but in the wake of their collapse, we may find great opportunity to transition to a more connected, ecological, and sustainable way of being.\n \nThis book is about how the money system will have to changeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and is already changingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to embody this transition. A broadly integrated synthesis of theory, policy, and practice, Sacred Economics explores avant-garde concepts of the New Economics, including negative-interest currencies, local currencies, resource-based economics, gift economies, and the restoration of the commons. Author Charles Eisenstein also considers the personal dimensions of this transition, speaking to those concerned with &quot;right livelihood&quot; and how to live according to their ideals in a world seemingly ruled by money. Tapping into a rich lineage of conventional and unconventional economic thought, Sacred Economics presents a vision that is original yet commonsense, radical yet gentle, and increasingly relevant as the crises of our civilization deepen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb10ad5a951bf2931336ed1b05dfeacd719cecd4","amp;dn":"Sacred+Economics%3A+Money%2C+Gift%2C+and+Society+in+the+Age+of+Transit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb10ad5a951bf2931336ed1b05dfeacd719cecd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,16,173,90,149,27,242,147,19,54,237,27,5,223,234,205,113,156,236,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
