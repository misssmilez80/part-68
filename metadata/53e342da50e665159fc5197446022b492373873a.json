Meanwhile, Chika admits to Tony that she's been having blackouts and has been controlled into altering the arc reactor, wanting to commit suicide for causing Tony's suffering. Just then, Kuroda approaches them in his Retetsu armor and takes \ncontrol of Chika, who had really been a Zodiac warrior, and has her attack Tony. As Tony tries to get Chika to believe in herself, she stabs herself to break free from Kuroda's control. Tony leaves Chika in Nanami's care while he goes to fight Kuroda, who was resentful due to his grandparents being killed \nin the Nagasaki bombing. Meanwhile, Chika decides to transfer her consciousness into the arc reactor program in order to take control of it and transfer its energy over to Iron Man. With the massive power provided, Iron Man unleashes a massive Unibeam that completely obliterates Kuroda, but Chika dies \nas a result of the transfer. A month later, the Arc Station is finally activated, providing clean energy for Japan, and Tony is seen returning to America.  \n       \n[b]Spoken Language: English[/b]\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nInfo\n=====\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 185M\nPlayTime           : 00:19:58.498\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 35919\nVideoBitRate       : 1155096\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFormat: Avi\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nScreens\n========\n\n[URL=http://img850.imageshack.us/i/ironman112endgameojavit.jpg/][IMG]http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/9907/ironman112endgameojavit.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nHash\n====\n53E342DA50E665159FC5197446022B492373873A\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e342da50e665159fc5197446022b492373873a","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+-+112+-+Endgame+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e342da50e665159fc5197446022b492373873a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,227,66,218,80,230,101,21,159,197,25,116,70,2,43,73,35,115,135,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
