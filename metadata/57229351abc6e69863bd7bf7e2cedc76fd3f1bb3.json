His first daughter inexplicably passes away, and both parents take extra special care of their second one. Unfortunately, she too starts suffering inexplicably, with the local doctor throws in the towel and asks her parents to pray for her soul. But both refuse to accept the doctor's verdict and set out to speak to a village elder by the name of Jasso, who asks them to go to Suku Baba who will surely find a way to cure their daughter. The parents travel on camel-back, find Suku Baba, who is already well aware of their plight and has a solution, namely that the parents must travel to another village, and cleanse the well that the upper caste Thakurs used to draw their water from years ago. The parents travel to this village, and ask around for this ascetic well - but nobody is willing to answer their question.\n\nMY COLLECTION PIC! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picturestack.com/415/35/QIfabcollecti9R8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picturestack.com/415/35/QIfabcollecti9R8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picturestack.com/476/460/MEeP230605040c6M.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picturestack.com/476/460/MEeP230605040c6M.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPLs Note: AUDIO VIDEO QUALLITY VERY LOW!!!\nplease use VLC Player. you can adjust with Equalizer for better audio video quality\n\nVideo: Xvid 352x288 29.97fps [Stream 00]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 128kbps [Stream 01]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57229351abc6e69863bd7bf7e2cedc76fd3f1bb3","amp;dn":"TARPAN-1995-Hindi-VHSRip-XviD-AB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57229351abc6e69863bd7bf7e2cedc76fd3f1bb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,34,147,81,171,198,230,152,99,189,123,247,226,206,220,118,253,63,27,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
