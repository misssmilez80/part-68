The owners, Mick and Martin Flannery, \nare keen to clear the scene so that they can open for business again, but after an \ninitial investigation, Eve is convinced that there is more to the case than a robbery \ngone wrong.\n\nHale visits Ray's home. Ray was from a Travelling community who are very suspicious \nof the police and refuse to tell Hale anything; they say they will deal with Ray's \ndeath themselves. Eve and Hale later discover that a young girl, Amanda, is also \nmissing and possibly in a lot of danger.\n\nEve must earn the trust of Ray's family by showing them that she is a scientist and \nonly motivated by finding justice for Ray. If they pursue their own justice then the \ntruth about what happened may remain hidden forever.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/du2Aj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/du2Aj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n::General::\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 575 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 1 373 Kbps\nDuration: 58mn 34s\nSample: NO\nSubtitles External:NO\n\n::Video Info::\n\nContainer: avc\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate: 1 200 Kbps\nResolution: 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16.9\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.167\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: (oan).Thanks!!\n\n::Audio Info::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 208 Kbps ((( Stereo )))\nMaximum Bitrate: 576 Kbps\nSample Rate: 44.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels [Front: L R]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:937c13e5d8202ec1a745d2ca3158ce6a426ab281","amp;dn":"BBC+-+The+Body+Farm+2011+6+of+6+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"937c13e5d8202ec1a745d2ca3158ce6a426ab281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,124,19,229,216,32,46,193,167,69,210,202,49,88,206,106,66,106,178,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
