Saints have a wonderful record at St Mary's but Boro's away form has \nunderpinned their impressive start to the season so it'll be intriguing to see which team \ncomes out on top. Meanwhile, Birmingham City face Brighton at St. Andrew's. \nChris Hughton's side has been involved in Europa League action for the first part of the \nseason so a Saturday outing is a rarity for the Blues; and they'll have their work cut out \nagainst Gus Poyet's Brighton, who have started the season strongly. Elsewhere, \nBurnley and Blackpool meet in a Lancashire derby; the last time they met, in the \nChampionship three seasons ago, Burnley did the double over the Tangerines. \nManish Bhasin presents.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a9dc494d16021abe660fbd4ec4373720a84aefa","amp;dn":"The+Football+League+Show+-+29th+October+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a9dc494d16021abe660fbd4ec4373720a84aefa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,157,196,148,209,96,33,171,230,96,251,212,236,67,115,114,10,132,174,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
