Dvorak bring you a free-flowing conversation that deconstructs recent news and media memes. Much of the appeal of the show comes from the odd couple relationship between the hosts. Adam Curry usually suggests theories about the news or world events, whereas John C. Dvorak has a more reasoned demeanor, and as acting as the &quot;Straight man&quot; to Curry.\n\nThe show has no advertisers, instead relying on its listeners to voluntarily donate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46385ce86e76d88bfef44a711e3b838a177b50c0","amp;dn":"No+Agenda+Show+2011+Episode+266-290","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46385ce86e76d88bfef44a711e3b838a177b50c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,56,92,232,110,118,216,139,254,244,74,113,30,59,131,138,23,123,80,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
