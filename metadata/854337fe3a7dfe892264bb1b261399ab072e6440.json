Born in the very centre of Sweden, he began writing music and lyrics when he was twelve. Went to USA to study art and music. Hitch-hiked, wrote songs, appeared on two TV shows, made some test recordings without any result.\nBack in Sweden he won a ticket to USA in a music competition. Played the guitar and sang at the Troubadour, Hollywood, Calif. Later he met Lars Samuelson - producer, trumpeter, arranger, conductor, music publisher - who decided Tomas Ledin was mature enough for a recording date. Through some radio and TV appearances locally was choosen as one of the Swedish participants in the Eurovision Song Festival 1972.\n(Frank Hedman, liner notes)\n\n- - -\n\n\nTomas Ledin - Restless Mind  1972\n(Stockholm Polydor 1991)\n\n 1.
