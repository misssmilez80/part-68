The answer may lie in another camp thousands of miles away, where a new camperÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â has shown up and appearsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â to be the son of Neptune, god of the sea.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â \nIn the first pages of this standalone sequel to The Lost Hero, Percy Jackson remembers only his name and the name of Annabeth, a mysterious woman he associates somehow with the city of San Francisco. From those sparse clues, he must somehow complete a mission for the leader of the Roman camp even as he is being pursued by the two sisters of Medusa, who possess an apparently unquenchable thirst for vengeance: Even when killed, they spring back to life.\n\nRick Riordan\\'s second Heroes of Olympus promises even more excitement than the first. With an ever-expanding cast of brave-hearted heroes and formidable foes, this book in The Heroes of Olympus series offersÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â all of theÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â action, pathos, and humor that Rick Riordan fans crave.\n\n\\&quot;From the Roman demigod camp to the prison of Death himself, The Son of Neptune reunites readers with old friends and introduces them to a whole new cast of characters. The Roman camp is a far cry from Camp Half-Blood, but it\\'s every bit as fascinating to explore. Our heroes battle up and down the West Coast with impossibly few days before disaster is unleashed, fighting new foes and finding new friends along the way. Some of the mysteries from The Lost Hero are solved, while others loom even larger. Rick Riordan is a master at balancing just the right amount of seriousness and levity in every situation, and his three teen narrators point out the strangeness of the iterations of ancient myths in the modern world with spot-on accuracy. With page-turning adventure, witty dialogue, and fun, fascinating characters, this second installment of the Heroes of Olympus series is a must-read for any fan of myths and fables.\\&quot;  --Malissa Kent\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:505da0e175c934800a356698867464a6b4a01b15","amp;dn":"The+Son+of+Neptune+by+Rick+Riordan+%28Chaptered+Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"505da0e175c934800a356698867464a6b4a01b15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,93,160,225,117,201,52,128,10,53,102,152,134,116,100,166,180,160,27,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
