Escaping from Number 10 and leaving behind his adoring wife Cherie (Catherine Shepherd), Tony vows to clear his name no matter what the consequences.\n\nBut on a foggy London night, Tony has few friends willing to harbour a wanted man. With front pages demanding his capture, Blair has no choice but to go on the run, with Inspector Hutton (Robbie Coltrane) and his sidekick (James Buckley) hot on his trail. The chase unfolds thanks to evidence gleaned from his 'allies' Mandelson (Nigel Planer) and Brown (Ford Kiernan), as well as an unlikely encounter with Margaret Thatcher (Jennifer Saunders, channelling Bette Davies in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?).\n\nSurely Tony's an innocent man, pursued for a crime he didn't commit?\n\nThe cast also includes Harry Enfield as Alastair Campbell, Rik Mayall as Professor Predictor, Morgana Robinson as Carole Caplin, John Sessions as Thatcher's butler and Ross Noble as an 'old Labour' tramp.\n\n\nStephen Mangan - Tony Blair\nCatherine Shepherd - Cherie Blair\nRobbie Coltrane - Inspector Hutton\nJames Buckley - Hutton's Sidekick\nNigel Planer - Peter Mandelson\nFord Kiernan - Gordon Brown\nJennifer Saunders - Margaret Thatcher\nJohn Sessions - Norman Tebbit, Thatcher's butler\nHarry Enfield - Alastair Campbell\nRik Mayall - Professor Predictor\nMorgana Robinson - Carole Caplin\nRoss Noble - An old Labour tramp\n\n\nThe Comic Strip Presents ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The Hunt For Tony Blair\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 45mn 52s\nBit rate                                 : 1 764 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\n\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 45mn 52s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 108 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:610b17b0189cfbf2c435f1b2eae18a8d1cde08d5","amp;dn":"The+Comic+Strip+Presents+%26acirc%3B%E2%82%AC%26brvbar%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"610b17b0189cfbf2c435f1b2eae18a8d1cde08d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,11,23,176,24,156,251,242,196,53,241,178,234,225,138,141,28,222,8,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
