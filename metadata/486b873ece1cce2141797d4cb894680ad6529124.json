The album spawned four singles, three of them charting successfully: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTalk Dirty to MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Want ActionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI WonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Forget YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCry ToughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The album is a prime example of the glam metal genre both musically and image-wise. The album ultimately has sold 4 million copies worldwide, one of their best-selling albums.The album was certified Gold in 1987 and 3x Multi-Platinum by the RIAA in 1990. The album has been certified by BPI silver and by CAN platinum.\nMusical style\n\nDescribed by Revolver Magazine as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œoversexed, under-thought, and relentlessly funÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s style is often described as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œglam metalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and was strongly influenced by East-Coast bands such as KISS and Aerosmith. It is a sound dominated by simple distorted power chords and catchy melodies. Reflecting a period before the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music began to take on the influence of Californian, Van Halen styled stadium rock, the album is characterized by more traditional heavy metal sounds.\n\nProduction and marketing\n\nThe record was described by vocalist Bret Michaels as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œglorified demoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. It was recorded at Music Grinder Studios in Los Angeles, California with producer Ric Browde in twelve days, for a cost of US $23,000, part of which was funded from the pockets of the band members and their families.\n\nThe front cover of the album featured the members of Poison at their most ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œglamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, with each sporting excessive make-up, thick girlish hair, and the pouting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œkissÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ pose which was to become a Poison trademark. The cover is often compared to MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Shout at the Devil because of the similar album cover, but it also may or may not have represented a loose parody of the cover of The BeatlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Let It Be, or perhaps more likely, Van HalenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut album.\n\nThemes and tracks\n\nThe albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s themes are ambition (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCry ToughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), lust (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Want ActionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTalk Dirty to MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWant Some, Need SomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), sexual frustration (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlame It on YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), love lost (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI WonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Forget YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), and, most importantly, anti-social behavior (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo. 1 Bad BoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLook What the Cat Dragged InÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLet Me Go to the ShowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPlay DirtyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTalk Dirty to MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was written by guitarist C. C. DeVille prior to his joining the band. DeVille played it to Bret Michaels, Rikki Rockett and Bobby Dall during his audition for the role as the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitarist. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTalk Dirty to MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has been covered by several bands, including Children of Bodom and Reel Big Fish. It is also included as a playable cover track in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, with Michaels re-recording the vocals.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Bret Michaels, C.C.
