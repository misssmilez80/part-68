There are three applications that make up Lotus Symphony: Lotus Symphony Documents, Lotus Symphony Spreadsheets, Lotus Symphony Presentations.\nLotus Symphony puts you in charge ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ take control over spiralling upgrade costs, ensure access to documents well into the future with new standard file formats (ODF), get more from your current investments with support for Microsoft Windows and Office file types.\n\nLotus Symphony on Debian based GNU/Linux:\n-----------------------------------------\nLotus Symphony will install on both i386 (32-bit) and amd64 (64-bit). Although IBM officially only released .deb files for i386. An Ubuntu user and OMG! Ubuntu reader, Dylan Coakley, has repackaged these i386 .deb files to be compatible with amd64 and thus they can be installed on amd64 Debian based GNU/Linux. These packages were announced on OMG! Ubuntu and are hosted on the project page for PhotoFiltre LX. The .deb files can be downloaded directly from the PhotoFiltre LX page, or preferably to save the PhotoFiltre LX project some bandwidth costs, they can be downloaded and redistributed with this BitTorrent release.\n\nThese packages have been tested as working on Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat 10.10 amd64 and above. Although the original packages released by IBM were built for Ubuntu Hardy Heron 8.04 i386.\n\nFuture Lotus Symphony amd64 .deb Releases:\n------------------------------------------\nWhilst Dylan may commit to repackaging amd64 .deb packages for future releases of Lotus Symphony, this may not be necessary as IBM committed to releasing amd64 .deb packages for future releases of Lotus Symphony, as stated in an email to Dylan[1]\n\nIBM have also committed to handing over stewardship of Lotus Symphony to the Apache Foundation[2] as have Oracle in regard to OpenOffice.org[3]\n\nInstallation\n============\n1.
