The show itself is a multi-camera shoot with excellent sound and video quality and the DVD also includes an interview from a radio station as well as acoustic performances of Cover Me and Far Behind.\n\nWe did rip the DVD too-- look for the XviD release of the main concert.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Arrow                                                [03:40]\n02.Simple lessons                                       [02:59]\n03.Change                                               [06:25]\n04.Blossom                                              [04:22]\n05.Don't you                                            [03:12]\n06.No sense                                             [06:02]\n07.Understanding                                        [04:25]\n08.You                                                  [05:17]\n09.A stone's throw away                                 [05:47]\n10.Sometimes                                            [04:47]\n11.10,000 horses                                        [05:41]\n12.Best friend                                          [03:13]\n13.Happy pills                                          [03:11]\n14.Far behind                                           [05:12]\n15.Cover me                                             [05:10]\n____\n\n69:23 min\n 89,4 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
