Though\nit quickly becomes apparent to Laura that Neil is psychologically disturbed, he quickly ushers her\nto the safety of a nearby warehouse, where many others have gathered to avoid the alien space\nprobes and zombie hordes. In time, the group discerns that the extraterrestrials have been using\nnanotechnology to enslave the human race, and that the only ones who remain unaffected are\nthe mentally imbalanced. As the voices in LauraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s head grow increasingly difficult to ignore, she\nand the rest of the survivors make one last, desperate attempt to destroy the device being used\nto control mankind, and send the aliens back into the stars.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1887676/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1887676/&lt;/a&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c353f5054f4325263de1b8ebd22b35cfb667808","amp;dn":"Battle+New+York%2C+Day+2+DVDRip-AR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c353f5054f4325263de1b8ebd22b35cfb667808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,53,63,80,84,244,50,82,99,222,27,142,189,34,179,92,251,102,120,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
