Although its historical accuracy has been questioned (inevitable as it is based on a novel about the facts, not the facts themselves), film critics consider this adaptation to be the best cinematic work inspired by the mutiny.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Laughton as Captain Bligh\nClark Gable as Fletcher Christian\nFranchot Tone as Byam\nHerbert Mundin as Smith\nEddie Quillan as Ellison\nDudley Digges as Bacchus\nDonald Crisp as Burkitt\nHenry Stephenson as Sir Joseph Banks\nFrancis Lister as Captain Nelson\nSpring Byington as Mrs. Byam\nMovita as Tehani\nMamo Clark as Maimiti (as Mamo)\nByron Russell as Quintal\nPercy Waram as Coleman\nDavid Torrence as Lord Hood\nJohn Harrington as Mr. Purcell\nDouglas Walton as Stewart\nIan Wolfe as Maggs\nDeWitt Jennings as Fryer\nIvan F.

Like the novel, it portrays Captain Bligh as an abusive villain whose cruelty towards the crew and most of the officers leads Christian to mutiny. When Bligh is cast on to a longboat with others that want to join him, Midshipman Roger Byam (Franchot Tone) tries to stop the mutiny, but fails. Christian leads the Bounty to Tahiti where the remaining crew live for many years. But Bligh has made it back to England and takes a ship to Tahiti. Byam sees the ship and decides to return to England while Christian with next to the whole crew sails with the natives and finds another island to live on. When Byam goes on the ship (unaware Bligh is captain of the ship) he is taken captive, for Bligh believes he had something to do with the mutiny.\n\nBack in England, Byam is court-martialed and found guilty. Before the court condemns him, Byam tells the court of Bligh's cruelty on the ship. Meanwhile, Christian has found Pitcairn Island, an island difficult to land on. He grounds the Bounty on the island and burns the ship so pursuers will not find Christian and his followers. Back in England Byam is pardoned and subsequently returns to sea.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:338e860330e1b429fb637b807a406aaaa1f49e52","amp;dn":"Best+Picture+-+1935+-+Mutiny+On+The+Bounty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"338e860330e1b429fb637b807a406aaaa1f49e52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,142,134,3,48,225,180,41,251,99,123,128,122,64,106,170,161,244,158,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
