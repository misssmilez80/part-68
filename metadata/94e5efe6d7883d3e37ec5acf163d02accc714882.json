Like his previous six solo albums, it has nothing more on its mind than a good time, a studio party where everybody is invited. This time around, Slash, Billy Gibbons, Bobby Womack and Flea all drop by to have a little fun on a collection rockers, reggae, blues and boogie, the sounds that have been Woody's stock in trade since 1974's I've Got My Own Album to Do. Everybody involved is a little bit older and straighter than the crew in '74, so the tempos don't push as hard, the guitars aren't quite as loud and the vocals are quite a bit more gravelly, but otherwise I Feel Like Playing is of a piece with what Woody has done before. And this is not a bad thing at all -- in fact, it's kind of remarkable that Wood has weathered as much as he has and is still capable as knocking out a record as relaxed and nonchalant as this. It's no dark night of the soul, it's just another good all-star jam but one where it doesn't sound like Wood is over-staying his welcome. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nTracklist\n1 Why You Wanna Go and Do a Thing Like That For  5:28\n\nFlea, Ivan Neville, Jim Keltner, Ronnie Wood Slash Jim Keltner Ivan Neville Flea, Slash \n\n2 Sweetness My Weakness 5:45\n\nBernard Fowler, Darryl Jones, Ronnie Wood Steve Ferrone Darryl Jones Bernard Fowler Slash, Slash, Steve Ferrone \n\n3 Lucky Man 5:03\n\nBernard Fowler, Bob Rock, Bobby Womack, Darryl Jones, Ian McLagan, Jim Keltner, Ronnie Wood Ian Mclagan Bobby Womack Bob Rock Darryl Jones Bernard Fowler Jim Keltner \n\n4 I Gotta See 3:44\n\nBernard Fowler, Billy F Gibbons, Flea, Ivan Neville, Jim Keltner, Ronnie Wood Billy F Gibbons Bernard Fowler Jim Keltner Ivan Neville Flea \n\n5 Thing About You 4:33\n\nBernard Fowler, Billy F Gibbons, Bobby Womack, Ronnie Wood Billy F Gibbons Bobby Womack Steve Ferrone Bernard Fowler, Steve Ferrone \n\n6 Catch You 4:05\n[color=deepskyblue]Bernard Fowler, Bob Rock, Darryl Jones, Ian McLagan, Jim Keltner, Ronnie Wood Ian Mclagan Bob Rock Darryl Jones Bernard Fowler Jim Keltner \n\n7 Spoonful 5:35\n\nBernard Fowler, Flea, Ian McLagan, Jim Keltner, Ronnie Wood Ian Mclagan Bernard Fowler Slash Jim Keltner Flea, Slash \n\n8 I Don't Think So5:02 \n9 100% 4:56\n\nBernard Fowler, Ian McLagan, Rick Rosas, Ronnie Wood Waddy Wachtel Rick Rosas Ian Mclagan Steve Ferrone Bernard Fowler, Steve Ferrone, Waddy Wachtel \n\n10 Fancy Pants 5:26\n\nDarryl Jones, Ivan Neville, Jim Keltner, Ronnie Wood Darryl Jones Slash Jim Keltner Ivan Neville, Slash \n\n11 Tell Me Something 3: 20\n\n12 Forever  4:45\n\nBernard Fowler, Bobby Womack, Darryl Jones, Ivan Neville, Jim Keltner, Ronnie Wood Bobby Womack Darryl Jones Bernard Fowler Slash Jim Keltner Ivan Neville, Slash\n\nRecording information: Bay 7 Studios, Valley Village, CA; Capitol Studios, Hollywood, CA; Drive-By Studios, North Hollywood, CA; House Of Blues Studios, Encino, CA; Sage &amp; Sound Studios, Hollywood, CA; The Steakhouse, North Hollywood, CA.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94e5efe6d7883d3e37ec5acf163d02accc714882","amp;dn":"Ronnie+Wood+I+Feel+Like+Playing%28rock%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94e5efe6d7883d3e37ec5acf163d02accc714882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,229,239,230,215,136,61,62,55,236,90,207,22,61,2,172,204,113,72,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
