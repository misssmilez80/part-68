After a confrontation, both decide to let bygones be bygones, fall in love with each other, and get married in a temple. Their marriage does not last long and soon they consult an advocate, who instructs them to live apart for two years, and then file for divorce, to which both agree. Circumstances force them to meet each other in a train compartment, and they must enact the roles of loving spouses in order to fool Ajay's friend, Ashok, as well as Suman's maternal uncle Jathashankar Bholenath and his wife.
