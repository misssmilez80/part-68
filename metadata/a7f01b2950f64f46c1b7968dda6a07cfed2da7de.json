His pioneering status and outstanding achievements have led to him being referred to as the &quot;Godfather of Canadian hip hop&quot;.\n\nIn 1989 he became the first Canadian rapper to have a Top 40 hit, &quot;Let Your Backbone Slide&quot;. As of early 2008, &quot;Let Your Backbone Slide&quot; remained the best-selling Canadian hip hop single of all time, and the only certified gold single in Canadian hip hop history. Eighteen years after its release, Maestro's debut album, Symphony in Effect (1989), remains the top selling Canadian hip hop album of all time; at 190,000 units sold, it is 10,000 shy of double platinum.\n\nAfter the success of his 1991 album, The Black Tie Affair, Maestro's career faltered as he attempted to break into the United States market. However, he returned to the Canadian charts in 1998, with the hit singles &quot;Stick to Your Vision&quot; and &quot;416/905 (T.O. Party Anthem)&quot;.\n\nIn 2000, &quot;Ever Since&quot; featured the track &quot;Bustin Loose&quot;, in which Maestro Fresh Wes teamed up with Kardinal Offishall.\n\nIn 2005, Maestro covered Lawrence Gowan's song &quot;A Criminal Mind&quot; (featuring Infinite); Gowan appears in the video and his vocals are sampled on the track. Gowan also performed the song with Maestro at the Canadian Urban Music Awards in 2006.\n\nIn 2006 Maestro again made Canadian hip hop history when he and Rochester AKA Juice joined The Dope Poet Society on stage in Cannes, France. Together, they become the first Canadian hip hop acts ever to showcase at Midem, the world's largest and most influential annual music industry conference.\n\nHe has had acting roles in the series Metropia, Instant Star, Platinum, Blue Murder, and The Line, as well as the films Poor Boy's Game, Get Rich or Die Tryin', Honey, and Four Brothers. As an actor, he is normally credited as Wes Williams.\n\nMaestro was inducted into the Scarborough Walk of Fame in 2006 and holds the following awards and distinctions: two Juno Awards, 12 Juno nominations, four MuchMusic Video Awards (People's Choice), first Canadian rap artist to go gold (album &amp; single), first Canadian hip hop single to go gold, platinum album - Best Selling Hip Hop Artist in Canadian History, UMAC Pioneer Award -1998, 2002 Harry Jerome Award for Excellence in Arts (Canada - NAACP), 2002 UMAC Special Achievement Award, and 2003 REEL World Film Festival Trailblazer Award. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymphony In Effect 1989\n\nSymphony in Effect is the debut album of Canadian rapper Maestro Fresh-Wes, released in 1989 on Attic/LMR Records.
