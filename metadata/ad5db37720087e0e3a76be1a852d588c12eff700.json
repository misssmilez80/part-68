Consumption expenditures by households in the United States account for about 70% of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s GDP. The primary focus in this book is on how households adjust these expenditures in response to changes in price and income. \n\nEconometric estimates of price and income elasticities are obtained for an exhaustive array of goods and services using data from surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and aggregate consumption expenditures from the National Income and Product Accounts, providing a better understanding of consumer demand. Practical models for forecasting future price and income elasticities are also demonstrated. Fully revised with over a dozen new chapters and appendices, the book revisits the original Houthakker-Taylor models while examining new material as well, such as the use of quantile regression and the stationarity of consumer preference. It also explores the emerging connection between neuroscience and consumer behavior, integrating the economic literature on demand theory with psychology literature. The most comprehensive treatment of the topic to date, this volume will be an essential resource for any researcher, student or professional economist working on consumer behavior or demand theory, as well as investors and policymakers concerned with the impact of economic fluctuations.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad5db37720087e0e3a76be1a852d588c12eff700","amp;dn":"Consumer+Demand+in+the+United+States+-+Prices%2C+Income%2C+and+Consu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad5db37720087e0e3a76be1a852d588c12eff700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,93,179,119,32,8,126,14,58,118,190,26,133,45,88,140,18,239,247,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
