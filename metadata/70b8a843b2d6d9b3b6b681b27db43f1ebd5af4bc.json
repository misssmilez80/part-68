Performing mostly with Jansch on acoustic guitar and Renbourn on electric, both playing in the traditional finger-picking style, the two spin dizzyingly complex webs of sound, soloing in counterpoint and playing in unison, sounding like two close friends who have been playing together for decades.\n\nHighlights include the playful &quot;Tic-Tocative,&quot; the exquisitely detailed &quot;Soho,&quot; and the lovely closer, &quot;After the Dance.&quot; But the centerpiece is a magnificent rendition of Charles Mingus' &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat,&quot; recasting the jazz standard as a folk-style tour de force.\n\nTracklist:\n1.
