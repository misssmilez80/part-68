It's VERY popular throughout Asia, and I'm not sure why it isn't recognized globally, but here are the 9 CDs from the 1979 TV Show.\n\nBasic Summary: Doraemon is a robot cat from the future who has been stuck in modern times. He lives with a nice family though, and the little boy Nobita is his best friend. Doraemon is constantly helping Nobita through the use of a variety of magical and technologically advanced tools from the future, which he can pull from his seemingly endless pocket.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcf93815c837fe0e2cdbc92b0ab95f38a931b7ea","amp;dn":"1979+Doraemon+Collection+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcf93815c837fe0e2cdbc92b0ab95f38a931b7ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,249,56,21,200,55,254,14,44,219,201,43,10,185,95,56,169,49,183,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
