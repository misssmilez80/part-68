Then they are the half-time show for the 99th Grey Cup between Vancouver and Winnipeg, in Vancouver. Methinks they love any kind of football to be doing two half-time shows in one week. \n\nMuch was made of the petition to NOT have them perform in Detroit. The band says it was down to one guy who was wanting that gig himself and who just wasn't happy with being rejected. So he got out a little propaganda and tried to get everyone to hate the decision. But apparently actual people in Detroit loved the idea of them doing the half-time show. -- Can you tell i watched an episode of Love Hate &amp; Propaganda before this show? -- No bad press? Also, Chad's new hair style is rather shocking the first time you see it.\n\nThis ET Canada special aired at 10.30 on 25 November 2011, after some movie about an iron man that was 2.5 hours on tv.
