Meanwhile, Liz treats Michael to an erotic\n        massage with Isha and Esha that ends with some well-oiled &quot;body surfing.&quot; \n        Despite the stimulation, Michael is unable to get it up.\n        He confides in Luther, who arranges a visit from The Nubian.\n        She strips, dances, and massages Michael's flaccid member, but\n        it's no go. Adding to Michael's woes is a visit from Jocelyn,\n        who thinks she has figured out that she's the reason for Michael's\n        robust sex drive.  Amazingly, Michael responds to Jocelyn's\n        overtures and they have sex. Afterwards, he consults Vic and\n        asks if guilt ever killed his sex life.  Vic theorizes that\n        Michael can't get it up with Liz because he's afraid their\n        relationship is more than just an affair.  Michael speaks to Liz,\n        who tells him she always knew that was true - their connection goes\n        beyond sex.\n                            \n                                 \n                                                  \n      \n            \n                                                     \n                                                 \n                                                                      \n\n      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here.
