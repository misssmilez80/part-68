But after Chic's breakup, they went their separate ways, became increasingly diverse, and produced their share of rock-oriented projects. The fact that Edwards had both rock and R&amp;B credentials made him the ideal producer for Grayson Hugh's Road to Freedom. Released in 1992 -- three years before Edwards' untimely death -- this generally appealing, if slightly uneven, CD has one foot in roots rock and Americana and the other in '60s-style soul. Fans of Bruce Springsteen, John Cougar Mellencamp, and Tom Petty should have no problem getting into earthy originals like &quot;Lost Avenue&quot; and &quot;Soul Cat Girl,&quot; but at the same time, Road to Freedom also has a lot of soul appeal -- Otis Redding, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, and Sam Cooke are all prominent influences. When this CD came out, one reviewer compared Hugh's phrasing to that of the Isley Brothers' Ronald Isley -- which isn't a bad comparison because Cooke was a major influence on Isley. And even if Isley isn't a direct influence on this album, there is no denying that Isley and Hugh have a mutual influence in Cooke. But whoever Hugh is compared to, he's a talented artist in his own right. And while Road to Freedom falls short of perfect, it is generally rewarding and is arguably the singer/songwriter's best release. ~ Alex Henderson, All Music Guide\n\n1\nHideaway\n2\nSoul Cat Girl\n3\nDon't Look Back\n4\nI Can't Untie You from Me\n5\nRoad to Freedom\n6\nForever Yours, Forever Mine\n7\nLost Avenue\n8\nThere's a Time\n9\nWalking Through the Fire\n10\nWhen She Comes Walking\n11\nFor the Innocent\n12\nI'll Remember You\n13 (Bonus)  Betty Wright &amp; Grayson Hugh - How 'Bout Us\n\nUploaded for the purpose of letting people hear this wonderful and talented artist.
