She doesn't drink or swear, and she has the appropriate percentage of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance between her and the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend America, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University's Walking One-Night Stand.\n\nTravis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needs--and wants--to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the charming college co-ed. Intrigued by Abby's resistance to his charms, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis' apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:471be4b7d009c25f1c2102247fc6b10026c90c39","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Disaster+-+Jamie+McGuire+MOBI%2FKINDLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"471be4b7d009c25f1c2102247fc6b10026c90c39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,27,228,183,208,9,194,95,28,33,2,36,127,198,177,0,38,201,12,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
