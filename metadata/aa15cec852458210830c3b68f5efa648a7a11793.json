LEA's simple and effective framework makes it useful to a wide audience of users throughout an enterprise, coordinating resources for business requirements and facilitating optimal adoption of technology.\n\nLightweight Enterprise Architectures provides a methodology and philosophy that organizations can easily adopt, resulting in immediate value-add without the pitfalls of traditional architectural styles. This systematic approach uses the right balance of tools and techniques to help an enterprise successfully develop its architecture.\n\nThe first section of the text focuses on how enterprises deploy architecture and how architecture is an evolving discipline. The second section introduces LEA, detailing a structure that supports architecture and benefits all stakeholders. The book concludes by explaining the approach needed to put the framework into practice, analyzing deployment issues and how the architecture is involved throughout the lifecycle of technology projects and systems.\n\nThis innovative resource tool provides you with a simpler, easily executable architecture, the ability to embrace a complex environment, and a framework to measure and control technology at the enterprise level.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 274 pages\n    * Publisher: Auerbach Publications; 1 edition (July 9, 2004)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 084932114X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0849321146","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa15cec852458210830c3b68f5efa648a7a11793","amp;dn":"Lightweight+Enterprise+Architectures%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa15cec852458210830c3b68f5efa648a7a11793","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,21,206,200,82,69,130,16,131,12,59,104,245,239,166,72,167,161,23,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
