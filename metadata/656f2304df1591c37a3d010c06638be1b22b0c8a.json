Now she examines the case histories of twelve of the most notorious serial killers of the last one hundred years, and answers the questions: What clues did they leave behind? How were they eventually caught? How was each twist and turn of their crimes matched by the equally compelling weapons of science and logic?\n\nFrom exploring the nineteenth century's earliest investigative tools to remarkable twenty-first century CSI advances, The Devil's Dozen provides a fascinating window into the world of those who kill-and those who dedicate their lives to bringing them to justice.\nAbout the Author\nKatherine Ramsland, Ph.D., numbers among her degrees a master's in forensic psychology from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. She has published thirty-three books, and writes forensic science articles for TruTV's Crime Library.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Format: Kindle Edition\n    * File Size: 1003 KB\n    * Print Length: 336 pages\n    * Page Numbers Source ISBN: 0425226034\n    * Publisher: Berkley; 1 edition (April 7, 2009)\n    * Sold by: Amazon Digital Services\n    * Language: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:656f2304df1591c37a3d010c06638be1b22b0c8a","amp;dn":"The+Devil%5C%27s+Dozen+%28mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"656f2304df1591c37a3d010c06638be1b22b0c8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,111,35,4,223,21,145,195,122,61,1,12,6,99,139,225,178,43,12,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
