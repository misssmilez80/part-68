THE GENIUS AFTER HOURS was originally released on Atlantic Jazzlore (0464) in August 1961.\n\n\n\n\nREVIEWS\n\nThis set is rather unusual, for it is strictly instrumental, allowing Ray Charles a rare opportunity to be a jazz-oriented pianist. Two selections are with a trio (bassist Oscar Pettiford joins Charles on &quot;Black Coffee&quot;), while the other six are with a septet taken from his big band of the period. \nKey among the sidemen are David Newman (soloing on both tenor and alto) and trumpeter Joseph Bridgewater; highlights include Quincy Jones' &quot;The Ray,&quot; &quot;My Melancholy Baby,&quot; &quot;Doodlin',&quot; and &quot;Undecided.&quot; \nRay Charles should have recorded in this setting more often in his later years. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\nIt's hard to go wrong with a Ray Charles album. However, fans of the man's beautifully expressive, bluesy voice may be in for a surprise with THE GREAT RAY CHARLES. An anomaly in the artist's huge discography, this disc is wholly instrumental, focusing on Charles' outstanding, jazz-influenced piano playing. The set is a mixture of standards (&quot;The Man I Love,&quot; &quot;Ain't Misbehavin'&quot;), contemporary pieces (Horace Silver's &quot;Doodlin',&quot; Quincy Jones' &quot;The Ray&quot;), and several of Charles' own fine compositions.\n\nThe absence of this entertainment legend's pipes allows the listener to fully concentrate on Charles' skill as an ivory-tickler. The musician cites both Bud Powell and Nat Cole as influences, and his style hangs beautifully in the balance between technical proficiency and a clean, emotional approach. Backed by a spare combo, this is perfect dinnertime music. A quiet but swinging album, THE GREAT RAY CHARLES only adds to the multi-talented genius' deservedly huge\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img263.imageshack.us/img263/1659/folderbzg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img263.imageshack.us/img263/1659/folderbzg.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n01.
