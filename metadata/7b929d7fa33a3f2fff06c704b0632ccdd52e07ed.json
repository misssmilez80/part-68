After spending 2009 and 2010 establishing themselves as a contender in the Toledo music scene playing with such acts as, Framing Hanley, Taproot, Finger, and The Fight Within, the band came to the decision that would both splinter and define the new band.\n\nIn late 2010 band friend and consultant, Brian Patrizzi, was selected to become the new full-time bassist for WTB, ending the era of longtime friend and ally, Michael (fakeMic) Hoersten as an active member of the group.\n\nLooking forward Weep the Beldam aims to garner regional and national attention with continued studio work and an increasing volume of &quot;power-packed&quot; performances. \n\nThe Release of their extended play demo &quot;The Carousel&quot; was announced in May 2011 for the spring and summer, and is available now by means of direct distribution.\n\n**320 kbps**\n\nTrack Listing:\n1. Spitting Image \n2. Faux Amis\n3. Choke Cycle\n4. Who Knew\n5. Jump Around (House of Pain cover)\n6. Under the Crown\n\nCheck out the demo, The Carousel, too and other live album!   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6692595/The_Carousel_(Demo)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6692595/The_Carousel_(Demo)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6692616/Weep_The_Beldam_LIVE_Peabody_s_(9_4)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6692616/Weep_The_Beldam_LIVE_Peabody_s_(9_4)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b929d7fa33a3f2fff06c704b0632ccdd52e07ed","amp;dn":"Weep+the+Beldam+LIVE+Peabody%5C%27s+%289%2F23%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b929d7fa33a3f2fff06c704b0632ccdd52e07ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,146,157,127,163,58,63,47,255,6,199,4,176,99,44,205,213,46,7,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
