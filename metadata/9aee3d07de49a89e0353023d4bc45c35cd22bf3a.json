After his twin dies in an accident, strange things happen to Jerry at a dizzying pace: a fortune shows up in his bank account, weapons are delivered to his flat, and a voice on his cell phone tells him the police are on their way. Jerry follows the voice's instructions, and soon he and a woman he's never met are racing through the city, on to a plane, and eventually to the Pentagon, chased by the FBI. She is Rachel Holloman, a single mom; the voice has threatened her son's death if she doesn't cooperate. The voice seems to know everything. Who is behind it, what is being planned, and why Jerry and Rachel?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aee3d07de49a89e0353023d4bc45c35cd22bf3a","amp;dn":"Eagle.Eye%5B2008%5DCS.DK.FI.FR.IT.NO.PT.SV.Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aee3d07de49a89e0353023d4bc45c35cd22bf3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,238,61,7,222,73,168,158,3,83,2,61,75,196,92,53,205,34,191,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
