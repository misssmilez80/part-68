Each season features a major case that Hewes and her firm take on, while also examining a chapter of the complicated relationship between Ellen and Patty. The series is also known for its depiction of the season-long cases both from the law firm's point of view and from the target's point of view. The series has attracted many stars to play characters on the side against Hewes, including Ted Danson, William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, Martin Short, Lily Tomlin, and John Goodman. Close and first-season star Zeljko Ivanek won Emmys for their performances, while several other actors have been nominated.\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=675437#pid675437&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=675437#pid675437&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t350 MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t43 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio :  \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t23.976 fps\nAudio: \t\t        MP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t10 + 2 Teaser + 1 txt = 13\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\n                        VISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5b3155554d8d9a06ffa3ec7a849a75811fb3e62","amp;dn":"Damages+-+Season+4+Complete+HDTV+%28XviD%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5b3155554d8d9a06ffa3ec7a849a75811fb3e62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,179,21,85,84,216,217,160,111,250,62,199,168,73,167,88,17,251,62,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
