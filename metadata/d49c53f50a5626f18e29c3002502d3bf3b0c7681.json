Traumatised and              \n    orphaned, Gulistan, Firat and their infant                \n    sister are placed in the care of their                     \n    young, politically-active aunt Yekbun who                  \n    soon disappears without a trace. As days               \n        turn into weeks, the money that their aunt             \n        left them runs out. Eventually, the children           \n        have to fend for themselves on the streets,            \n    where one day, Gulistan is shocked to come             \n    across the murderer of her parents.                    \n                                                           \n                 \n                                                 \n                                                     \n                                                     \n                                                               \n    Senay Orak as Glstan                                 \n    Muhammed Al as Firat                                   \n        Hakan Karsak as Nuri Kaya                              \n        Suzan Ilir as Zelal                                    \n        Bervan Ayaz as Dilan 'Dilara'                         \n    Fahriye elik as Mother                                   \n    Alisan nl as Father                                      \n    Bervan Eminoglu as Aunt Yakbun                            \n    Mehmet Inci as Mkal                                  \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                     \n                                            \n                                              \n                                                \n                                                           \n        We are currently doing high quality XviD, TV           \n        and DVD Rips.                                          \n        We are always looking for new talent,                  \n    newbie or pro we want you!                                \n                                                               \n    If u wanna learn to rip quality Xvid or DVD                \n    we can teach you.                                      \n                                                               \n        We are always interested in affiling good              \n        sites in europe or asia.                               \n                                                           \n    IF you think you can provide anything that             \n    could be of use for us (shells, bots, dumps,               \n    coding or anything else you can think of)                  \n       do contact us with an offer we cannot refuse              \n        :-)                                                    \n                                                               \n                                                            \n                                                           \n             \n                                             \n                                                 \n                                                  \n                                                           \n         To all quality minded groups in the scene.            \n               And to all our old members.                     \n                                                               \n             \n                                      \n                                              \n                                               \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n              You can contact us by messaging us.             \n              Where you say?
