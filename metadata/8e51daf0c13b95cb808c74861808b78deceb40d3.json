Installed into VMware, and then the files were compressed (just run the .exe to extract) and even comes with a little setup tutorial in case you're unsure.\n\nShouldn't run into any difficulties, if you do just give me a buzz. Cheers and remember to seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e51daf0c13b95cb808c74861808b78deceb40d3","amp;dn":"Windows+8+Developer+Preview+VMware+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e51daf0c13b95cb808c74861808b78deceb40d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,81,218,240,193,59,149,203,128,140,116,134,24,8,183,141,236,235,64,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
