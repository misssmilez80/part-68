But when he finds his friend Rebecca Morley near death in the Spirit Mountains, Han knows that nothing matters more than saving her. The costs of his efforts are steep, but nothing can prepare him for what he soon discovers: the beautiful, mysterious girl he knew as Rebecca is none other than Raisa anaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Marianna, heir to the Queendom of the Fells. Han is hurt and betrayed. He knows he has no future with a blueblood. And, as far as heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s concerned, the princessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family killed his own mother and sister. But if Han is to fulfill his end of an old bargain, he must do everything in his power to see Raisa crowned queen.\n\nMeanwhile, some people will stop at nothing to prevent Raisa from ascending. With each attempt on her life, she wonders how long it will be before her enemies succeed. Her heart tells her that the thief-turned-wizard Han Alister can be trusted. She wants to believe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s saved her life more than once. But with danger coming at her from every direction, Raisa can only rely on her wits and her iron-hard will to surviveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and even that might not be enough.\n\n\n\n//////////////////////////////////\nCouldn't find this here so figured I would share\n\nEven a thanks goes a long way!\n//////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f98e26e217cf48457cdbd3806544206559c8c52c","amp;dn":"Cinda+Williams+Chima","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f98e26e217cf48457cdbd3806544206559c8c52c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,142,38,226,23,207,72,69,124,219,211,128,101,68,32,101,89,200,197,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
