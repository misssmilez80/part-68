In the Civil War he was a rebel whose honor put him afoul of a confederate general, Turnbull, who murdered Jonah's family while Jonah watched. As a result of the ordeal, Jonah's face is disfigured and he can talk with the dead. After staging his own death, Turnbull, with a group of rebel stalwarts, hatches a plan to bring the Union to its knees. Grant wants Hex to stop it. While the nation readies to celebrate Independence Day, Hex and an unlikely ally have little time to stop Turnbull and his weapon of mass destruction. \n\n\n\n\nFile Name: Jonah Hex 2010.avi\nFile Size: 700 MB\n\n[Container]\nFormat: AVI  (AVI format)\nDuration: 01:21:31.80\nBit Rate: 1,200 kbps\n\n[Video]\nCodec: MPEG4  (MPEG-4 part 2)\nCodec Tag: XVID (0x44495658)\nPicture Size: 704x288  (PAR 1:1, DAR 22:9)\nFrame Rate: 23.98 fps\nBit Rate: 1,088 kbps\n\n[Audio]\nCodec: MP3  (MP3 (MPEG audio layer 3))\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 48,000 Hz\nSample Data Format: 16 bits (Integer)\nBit Rate: 112 kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0556b93986cc60b32571522631103b29cfe5b70","amp;dn":"Jonah+Hex+2010+%5BMissouriMike%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0556b93986cc60b32571522631103b29cfe5b70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,85,107,147,152,108,198,11,50,87,21,34,99,17,3,178,156,254,91,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
