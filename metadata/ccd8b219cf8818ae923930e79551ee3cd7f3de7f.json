Readers will gain an understanding of the conceptual design elements and specific analysis methods for supercritical-pressure light water cooled reactors. Nuclear fuel, reactor core, plant control, plant stand-up and stability are among the topics discussed, in addition to safety system and safety analysis parameters. Providing the fundamentals of reactor design criteria and analysis, this volume is a useful reference for engineers, industry professionals, and graduate students involved with nuclear engineering and energy technology.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 447 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (July 1, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1441960341\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1441960344","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccd8b219cf8818ae923930e79551ee3cd7f3de7f","amp;dn":"Super+Light+Water+Reactors+and+Super+Fast+Reactors%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccd8b219cf8818ae923930e79551ee3cd7f3de7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,216,178,25,207,136,24,174,146,57,48,231,149,81,238,60,215,243,222,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
