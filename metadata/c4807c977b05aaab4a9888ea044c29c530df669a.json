As Beast administers the vaccine to various mutants, some of which have already started going through secondary mutation, the other X-Men investigate the abnormalities, including a strange \nvolcanic area by the river and a twisted metal bridge. As the X-Men fly towards the centre of the area in which mutants have been affected by secondary mutation, Emma starts hearing a painful noise and the Blackbird is shot down. Upon landing, the X-Men witness the Blackbird being attacked by living snow \nbefore they are attacked by another U-Man, who uses their powers against them. However, Beast manages to find its weakpoint, allowing the others to defeat him. They spot he has a mutant detection device before he self-destructs himself. As a snowstorm kicks in, the X-Men finds shelter in a lodge owned by Yui Sasaki, the woman Xavier mentioned, who was the headmaster of a mutant institute Hisako went to when she was little.  \n\nSpoken Language:- English\n\n=============================\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n[URL=http://img716.imageshack.us/i/xmen106conflictconteste.jpg/][IMG]http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/4883/xmen106conflictconteste.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n================================\n\nFile Info\n----------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 176M\nPlayTime           : 00:19:58.398\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 35916\nVideoBitRate       : 1094252\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\n\nFormat:- AVI\n\n=============================\n\nHash\n-----\nC4807C977B05AAAB4A9888EA044C29C530DF669A\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4807c977b05aaab4a9888ea044c29c530df669a","amp;dn":"X-Men+-+106+-+Conflict+%7E+Contested+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4807c977b05aaab4a9888ea044c29c530df669a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,128,124,151,123,5,170,171,74,152,136,234,4,76,41,197,48,223,102,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
