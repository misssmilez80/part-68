Horstmann (San Jose State University)\nDecember 2009, Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©2010\nISBN 978-0-470-50948-7\n\nThis book introduces programmers to objects at a gradual pace. The syntax boxes are revised to show typical code examples rather than abstract notation. This includes optional example modules using Alice and Greenfoot. The examples feature annotations with dos and don'ts along with cross references to more detailed explanations in the text. New tables show a large number of typical and cautionary examples. New programming and review problems are also presented that ensure a broad coverage of topics. In addition, Java 7 features are included to provide programmers with the most up-to-date information.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc3c0eb1e428dc6c5d1da76f21ec78b930bd9565","amp;dn":"Big_Java_Compatible_with_Java_5_6_7_4th_Edition.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc3c0eb1e428dc6c5d1da76f21ec78b930bd9565","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,60,14,177,228,40,220,108,93,29,167,111,33,236,120,185,48,189,149,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
