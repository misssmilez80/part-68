They soon cross paths with lovelorn scientist Charles Darwin, who persuades the Captain that the crew's prized 'parrot', Polly, could be the answer to the 'untold riches' they are searching for. Their adventure takes them to Victorian London where they meet Darwin's sidekick 'man-panzee' Mister Bobo, and the notorious pirate-hating Queen Victoria herself. It soon unfolds that Darwin's motives for helping the crew are not what they seem, and the Queen has an evil hidden agenda of her own. The Pirate Captain must choose between basking in the glory of being crowned Pirate of the Year, or staying faithful to his trusted crew.\n\n\n\nGreetings Realuploads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:826660c9b2c0673c0cd5c9bd84be7a9e788d411e","amp;dn":"The+Pirates%21+Band+of+Misfits+%28+Nordic+%2F+Multi+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"826660c9b2c0673c0cd5c9bd84be7a9e788d411e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,102,96,201,178,192,103,60,12,213,201,189,132,190,122,158,120,141,65,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
