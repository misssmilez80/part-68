She became a superstar across Europe also, quite soon, she became known for her self-confident and individual style, ever since she turned a celebrity. There have been lots of rumours and publicity about her private wild life, some of these are just rumours and some of them are perhaps true. That explains all that talking and gossip - a fascination for this special female and artist. She is described by friends as well as enemies as a kind of artist genius with a big and warm heart. In 1993, Leila K was the bestselling female artist in Europe and in 1997, she was appointed International Artist of the Year, ahead of f. ex. Madonna in Finland.\n\nLeila K Greatest Tracks, is an album loaded with great songs and many huge hits, made by some of the best producers and songwriters in the world at the time. The idea behind this definitive collection has been to honour one of the most spectacular scandinavian female artists of our time, beyond the big hits and well-known tracks. We have dug out a few tracks that have never been previously released, so for the first time on a Leila K album, you can enjoy Positive Energy, Possessed and Burning Up.\n(liner notes)\n\n- - -\n\nLeila K - Greatest Tracks 1989-2001\n(2CD Stockholm Bonnier Music 2003)\n\n 1.
