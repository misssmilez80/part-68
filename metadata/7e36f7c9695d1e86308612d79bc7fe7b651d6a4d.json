They have recently played with the likes of Florence and the Machine and Jamie T, as well as selling out their own nationwide tour. Originally commencing as a solo project, they were still known as (just) Ernest Ellis until recently when they decided to add to their moniker, once and for all declaring themselves as a collective.\n\nClearly a reflective bunch, KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Canyon is a beautifully poignant album, a result of their everyday emotion and passion. The lyrics and overall scope of many of the songs can be quite heartrending, but in a way where you can still see a way out. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s honest. \n\nThe albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreat SkyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ gives that exact impression, a big infinite space. Recorded with high levels of reverb and echoed backing vocals, they cleverly give what is in actuality a very large track a withdrawn feel. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSave MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is one of the more upbeat songs, tempo wise at least. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s definitely a toe-tapper, and reminds of a time when Kings of Leon werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t shit. Ellis, who has been quoted as feeling unconfident in his voice, does himself proud with his wailing vocals soaring throughout. The opening track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSons and DaughtersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ may be my favourite, a track which delves into deep melancholy before finishing on a powerful and victorious spike.\n\nI read an interview about the recording process, how they wanted to create a rounded album, not a couple of good singles surrounded by filler. This is exactly what they have accomplished.\n\nweb flac download\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/10/26/ernest-ellis-the-panamas/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e36f7c9695d1e86308612d79bc7fe7b651d6a4d","amp;dn":"Ernest+Ellis+%26amp%3B+The+Panamas...Kings+Canyon%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e36f7c9695d1e86308612d79bc7fe7b651d6a4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,54,247,201,105,93,30,134,48,134,18,215,155,199,254,123,101,29,106,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
