He spends his days &quot;staring at his desk&quot; instead of reprogramming bank software to be Y2K-compliant. His co-workers include Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu), who is annoyed by the fact that nobody can pronounce his last name correctly; Michael Bolton (David Herman), who loathes having the same name as the famous singer, whom he hates; and Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), a meek, fixated collator who constantly mumbles to himself (most notably about his workmates' borrowing his favorite red Swingline stapler and about his plan or threat to set the workplace on fire). Milton had been laid off years earlier, but due to a payroll computer glitch, was never informed, and therefore has received regular paychecks. All four are repeatedly bullied and harassed by management, especially Initech's smarmy, callous vice president, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). The staff are further agitated by the arrival of two consultants, Bob Slydell (John C. McGinley) and Bob Porter (Paul Willson), who are brought in to help with cutting expenses, mainly through downsizing.\n\n::Trackers::\nCode: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://solotorrents.com/announce.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://solotorrents.com/announce.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInfo Hash:269CDB4A4C03816D6A454C1123235FDE28B3CD37 \n\n::Screen Shots::\n[img]http://img522.imageshack.us/img522/4204/90190500.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/1224/28290956.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/6841/12221459.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6889/19382860.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img853.imageshack.us/img853/7691/28812483.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/1417/15902751.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/418/93368747.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1671/85294531.png[/img]\n\nwe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n::Greetz::\nTo All Silver RG Encoders,AliBaloch,Emad,TrT/TcT,Torrentstate,DarkNight,MXMG,BigW &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n::Note::\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silvertorrents.me,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\n::Support::\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:269cdb4a4c03816d6a454c1123235fde28b3cd37","amp;dn":"Office+Space+1999+720p+BRRip+Ali+Baloch+Silver+RG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"269cdb4a4c03816d6a454c1123235fde28b3cd37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,156,219,74,76,3,129,109,106,69,76,17,35,35,95,222,40,179,205,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
