Nowhere to be found! Its isn't just arrogant\nfor them to act this way, not even just inane in poor business judgment\n- but rather O would suggest &quot;insane&quot; better fits the picture of the\nbureaucrat in Hollywood named Bill Gates who has not a clue of when he's\nacting too much like hes' missing a full deck to give a darn as he should\nbe made to! I guess they don't need the money, jut the joy of inflicting\npetty ans insane decisions on a movie audience that deserves better now\nthat we've grown attached to this release.\n\nWell anyways, as long a you never pay the man again, my time hasn't been\nwasted in this regard too, as he does nothing but put out rubbish lately\nhaving altogether gone senile in losing his marbles completely it would seem.\n\nGreat music though, I sourced the main song features in flac files\nwhich I converted into great mp3 quality (the song &quot;Good Times&quot; sounds\nlike dance hall quality - I kid you not!) some are remastered and a bit\nof licence is taken with a song done by Sinatra which we gave to Julie\nLondon here as Sinatra appears on another title below in fine form already!\n\nAll are at 320k except one that is nowhere to be found in any better than 192k however it sounds just as good I assure you - so I apologize if you feel\nmistook here in any such respect too.\n\nEnjoy this thrilling set of songs \n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo\n\n\nAntonio Carlos Jobim - How Insensitive (featured with Frank Sinatra)\nDusty Springfield - Wishin' and Hopin'\nElvis Presley - (Marie's The Name) His Latest Flame\nFine Young Cannibals - Good Thing\nFine Young Cannibals - She Drives Me Crazy\nFine Young Cannibals - Social Security\nFine Young Cannibals - Suspicious Minds\nFine Young Cannibals - Tell Me What\nGene Pitney - (The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance\nJo Stafford - All Things You Are\nJo Stafford - You Belong To Me\nJohnny Mathis - It's Not for Me to Say\nJulie London - In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning\nNat King Cole - Sweet Lorraine (Digitally remastered)\nOtis Redding - Try A Little Tenderness\nRitchie Valens - La Bamba (Digitally remastered)\nThe Lafayettes - Lifes-Too-Short\nVic Damone - The Girl from Ipanema","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52665a2f8b367219306e09792897a6d59a8e29ce","amp;dn":"Songs+from+Tin+Men+%281987%29+320k+%28musicfromrizzo%29+soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52665a2f8b367219306e09792897a6d59a8e29ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,102,90,47,139,54,114,25,48,110,9,121,40,151,166,213,154,142,41,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
