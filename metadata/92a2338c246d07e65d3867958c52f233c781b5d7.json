Village Gorilla Head is his first nominal solo album after records with post-Mats outfits Bash &amp; Pop and Perfect, and fits the modest mold of a guy who's always seemed happy just to be in the band: no worries about escaping the Replacements' shadow for him. Just as well, as Gorilla leans heavily on a conversational bar-band rock that'll ring familiar with All Shook Down fans. They'll delight in Stinson's pointed observations: &quot;I heard about the things you done/From the dry cleaner's girlfriend's son.&quot;, &quot;I couldn't wait to miss you, but I couldn't wait to kiss you.&quot;, &quot;You took a turn at Silverlake and now you're calling it your home.&quot; Maybe not a sweepstakes winner, but Stinson remains a one-of-a-kind. --Rickey Wright","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92a2338c246d07e65d3867958c52f233c781b5d7","amp;dn":"Tominson+-+2004+-+Village+Gorilla+Head","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92a2338c246d07e65d3867958c52f233c781b5d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,162,51,140,36,109,7,230,93,56,103,149,140,82,242,51,199,129,181,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
