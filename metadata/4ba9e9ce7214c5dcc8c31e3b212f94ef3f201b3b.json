Most people ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from religious extremists to secular scientists ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ would agree on one point: that science has nothing to say on the subject of human values. Indeed, science's failure to explain meaning and morality has become the primary justification for religious faith and the reason why even many non-believers feel obliged to accord respect to the beliefs of the devout.\n\nSam Harris, the American philosopher and neuroscientist, comes to the IntelligenceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â² stage to argue that these views are mistaken ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that amidst all the competing arguments about how we should lead our lives, science can show us that there are right and wrong answers. This means that moral relativism is mistaken and that there can be neither a Christian nor a Muslim morality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and that ultimately science can and should determine how best to live our lives.\n\nSam Harris will be discussing his latest book The Moral Landscape: How Science can Determine Human Values with Revd Dr Giles Fraser, Canon Chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba9e9ce7214c5dcc8c31e3b212f94ef3f201b3b","amp;dn":"sam-harris-IQ2.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba9e9ce7214c5dcc8c31e3b212f94ef3f201b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,169,233,206,114,20,197,220,200,195,30,59,33,47,148,239,63,32,27,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
