He often fails to\nlet his employer in on his plots, and a large proportion of his schemes\nturn out to expose Bertie to ridicule.\n\nYet Jeeves also ensures that Bertie's life runs smoothly, steering him\nthrough the pitfalls which face a rich young man with too much time\non his hands. When in one story Bertie overhears Jeeves describing his\nemployer as &quot;not intelligent&quot;, he sets out to disprove the butler's\nassessment. If it is predictable that things do not go according to\nplan, then it is Wodehouse's brilliant grasp of comedy which makes the\nmanner in which things go wrong so constantly surprising. And, of course,\nby the end of the tale Jeeves has proved himself both inimitable and\nindispensable.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9e3f1689f0ebcca346cbe224cb4870071532406","amp;dn":"The+Inimitable+Jeeves+-+P.+G.+Wodehouse++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9e3f1689f0ebcca346cbe224cb4870071532406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,227,241,104,159,14,188,202,52,108,190,34,76,180,135,0,113,83,36,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
