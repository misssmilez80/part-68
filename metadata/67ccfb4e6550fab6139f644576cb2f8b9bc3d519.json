Originally known as simply Blink, the band debuted in 1993 with a self-released EP, Fly Swatter. After releasing the album Buddha in 1994, the trio signed to Grilled Cheese/Cargo and released Cheshire Cat the following year. The threat of a lawsuit from a similarly named Irish band forced them to change their name to Blink-182, but the group earned a higher profile touring the world with Pennywise and NOFX on the 1996-1997 Warped Tour, plus appearing on innumerable skate/surf/snowboarding videos. \n\nReleased: Sept 27, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Punk-Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n1.
