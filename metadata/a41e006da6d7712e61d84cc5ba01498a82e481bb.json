Afterwards, she gives him a painting he admired.\n        Real estate developer Mason Dorring admires it when he visits\n        Michael's office, and Michael sells it to him for $20G.  Michael\n        gives the check to Liz, who demands he get the painting back -\n        she doesn't sell her work.  When Michael refuses, Liz goes to\n        Mason's hotel room, demands the return of her painting, and\n        punches a hole in the canvas when he refuses.\n        In the meantime, Michael helps Jocelyn rewrite a speech she's\n        giving at a trade conference.  The speech streams live, and it\n        looks like a flop.  Michael dodges Jocelyn's calls, but finally\n        decides to face the music:  what looked like stony silence was\n        actually an audience of Danes too polite to laugh.  Liz\n        reconsiders her behavior and allows Mason to select another\n        canvas.  She tells Michael that, ever since her parents sold her\n        grandmother's collection of travel souvenirs, she has been\n        reluctant to part with anything that means something to her.\n        Michael spots Mason's check under a snow globe (Liz's sole\n        memento of her grandmother), and smiles to think that Liz is\n        slowly letting her guard down.\n                            \n                                 \n                                                  \n      \n            \n                                                     \n                                                 \n                                                                      \n\n      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here.
