He had read about the story in a book called The Irish Soldiers of Mexico by American historian, Mexican resident and authority on the San Patricios, Michael Hogan.\n\n Other singers who documented events in RileyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life include Nashville bluegrass star, Tim O'Brien who co-wrote the song John Riley with the legendary Guy Clark. New York Irish rockers, Black 47 penned a song called San Patricio as did folk singer Thom Moore, while Ron Kavana wrote The Men That God Made Mad about Riley and his men. That was recorded by Niamh Parsons and others. In addition, the Chieftains and Ry Cooder did a whole album last year around the San Patricios.\n\nLinks:\nwww.tg4.ie\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.charlieobrien.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.charlieobrien.net&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/charlieobrien&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/charlieobrien&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8307d5ff6728c6ed969dc4eee9029b7ddea79c23","amp;dn":"Life+Of+John+Riley+TG4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8307d5ff6728c6ed969dc4eee9029b7ddea79c23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,7,213,255,103,40,198,237,150,157,196,238,233,2,155,125,222,167,156,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
