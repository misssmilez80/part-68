The show features auctioneer Dan Dotson, as well as auction hunters Dave Hester, Darrell Sheets, Barry Weiss, and Jarrod Schulz. When rent is not paid on a storage locker for three months in California, the contents are sold by an auctioneer as a single lot of items. The show follows professional buyers who purchase the contents based only on a 5 minute inspection and what they can see only from the door when it is opened. The goal is to turn a profit on the merchandise.\n\n*REAL* S02E05\nUnclaimed Baggage\nAugust 3, 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bbc4912c37a1cabe32b5f986d1950f955edd23d","amp;dn":"Storage.Wars.S02E05.DIRFIX.HDTV.CRiMSON.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bbc4912c37a1cabe32b5f986d1950f955edd23d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,188,73,18,195,122,28,171,227,43,95,152,109,25,80,249,85,237,210,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
