Following the axiom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Maximum Volume Yields Maximum Results,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ their live shows are an exercise in tone and feel. The sludgy, plodding dual bass guitar attack shakes the very ground one is on while the unrelenting drums pound on and on. Bridesmaid has a pretty simple philosophy and plan, with the axiom they follow, they plan on shaking Midwest America to the ground. \nColumbus Ohio's Sludged Out Doom Factory.\n\nA earth shaking sludge / doom beast that uses lo-end as a weapon.\nBob and Scott assualt the ears and shake the ribs with their dual bass sludge attack while Cory pounds the drums in a ritualistic frenzy of beats that reminds one of huge lumbering herds of dinosaurs destroying all in their path.\nBridesmaid throws their own spin when it comes to the sludge / doom they deliver to the listeners ears producing blow after blow of nonstop headbanging music that marches onward to oblivion.\n\n\n\nCurrent lineup\nBob Brinkman - Bass\nScott Hyatt - Bass\nCory Barnt - Drums\n\n\n*This release is my personal rip, if you like the band be sure to support the band and buy their merch.\n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d23f6c325e745127556f3615a187e3176c7ec39","amp;dn":"Bridesmaid+-+The+Davy+Jones+Industrial+Average+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d23f6c325e745127556f3615a187e3176c7ec39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,35,246,195,37,231,69,18,117,86,243,97,90,24,126,49,118,199,236,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
