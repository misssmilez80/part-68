The deadliest strike was in Haiti, where a quake just southwest of the capital, Port-au-Prince, killed more than 200,000, reducing homes, hospitals, schools, and the presidential palace to rubble. In exclusive coverage, a NOVA camera crew follows a team of US geologists as they first enter Haiti in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy. It is a race against time as they hunt for crucial evidence that will help them determine exactly what happened deep underground and what the risks are of a new killer quake. Barely a month after the Haiti quake, Chile was struck by a quake 100 times more powerful, unleashing a tsunami that put the entire Pacific coast on high alert. In a coastal town devastated by the rushing wave, NOVA follows a team of geologists as they battle aftershocks to measure the displacement caused by the earthquake. Could their work, and the work of geologists at earthquake hot-spots around the U.S., one day lead to a breakthrough in predicting quakes before they happen? NOVA investigates new leads in its investigation of a deadly scientific conundrum.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/img232/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/img232/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/9360/deadliestearthquakesscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2039 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce1014e9cefb9c53c301cd134414d4dacf53ea5","amp;dn":"Deadliest+Earthquakes+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce1014e9cefb9c53c301cd134414d4dacf53ea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,225,1,78,156,239,185,197,60,48,28,209,52,65,77,77,172,245,62,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
