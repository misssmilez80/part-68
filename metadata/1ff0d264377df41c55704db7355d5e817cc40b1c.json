The subjects range from dynamo and reconnection processes in magneto-hydrodynamics and electromagnetic turbulence to fast transport events in self-organized turbulence. Such phenomena, recognized as key bolts in our present understanding, turn out to be extremely challenging for theoretical models. This book efficiently helps to bridge our understanding and description of such processes, analogously observed in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 336 pages\n# Publisher: World Scientific Publishing Company (December 21, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 9814291544\n# ISBN-13: 978-9814291545","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ff0d264377df41c55704db7355d5e817cc40b1c","amp;dn":"Relaxation+Dynamics+in+Laboratory+and+Astrophysical+Plasmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ff0d264377df41c55704db7355d5e817cc40b1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,240,210,100,55,125,244,28,85,112,77,183,53,93,94,129,124,196,11,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
