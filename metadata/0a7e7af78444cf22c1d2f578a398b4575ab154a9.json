The events take place on an open world battlefield divided between two factions, each trying to capture bases from the opposite side until the enemy has been wiped out from the area. The player takes the role of a private and fights along his/her comrades controlled by AI, slowly gaining influence over fellow soldiers through rank promotions from success in battles.\n\nWhen the influence grows, AI soldiers begin to follow the player starting as a combat pair, ultimately forming a 10-member squad. The AI squad commanding has been made as transparent as possible to avoid micromanagement and excess amount of keys or menus. The AI squad members e.g. find cover on leaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signal from crouching, they spot enemies on their own and open fire if it fits the situation. When the leader uses a suppressed weapon for stealth approach, the squad will engage in fight only if the enemy manages to alert the surroundings by shouting or shooting.\n\nThe soldiers die quickly, and the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soldier makes no exception. The game uses the simplest possible die-or-donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bullet hit model, which makes the gameplay extremely intense and challenging. Caution, frequent usage of covers, suppressing fire to buy time and staying with the group is highly encouraged; the heroic rambo-style risk taking will likely lead only to a quick death.. itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a beautiful way to go though.\n\n\nHowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it going with the project Ã¢â‚¬â€œ where are we now?\n\n3x 1km * 1km maps with 7-14 bases each\ntotal amount of soldiers up to 600 based on playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preferences\nsingle player and online multiplayer modes, server browser\ntwo assault rifles, AK47 and G36\ntwo light machine guns M240 and PKM\nsuppressed submachine gun MP5 SD\nshotgun Mossberg 500\nsniper rifle M24-A2\ngrenades and mortar strikes\ntake cover in trenches, behind sandbag walls, trees, crates and rocks, go crouch and prone (now with movement!), access roof tops\nday time changes; during the night the soldiers wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see that far and wide, enabling better stealth opportunities\ncommander AI orders squad leaders to move around in the world where needed\nkilled in action, the player is simply reborn a different soldier (with rank retained) in the nearest peaceful base\nreinforcements spawn in each of the bases at times; thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a maximum soldier capacity for each nation depending on amount of occupied bases\nsimple squad control; command the squad to move to a position or regroup back to leader\nbasic support for model, weapon and map modding; possibility to import custom meshes\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modulaatio.com/runningwithrifles/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modulaatio.com/runningwithrifles/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a7e7af78444cf22c1d2f578a398b4575ab154a9","amp;dn":"Running+with+Rifles+v0.68","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a7e7af78444cf22c1d2f578a398b4575ab154a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,126,122,247,132,68,207,34,193,210,245,120,163,152,180,87,90,177,84,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
