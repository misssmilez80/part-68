Along with some graphical updates (the game looks downright beautiful) and online coop, the characters are getting some new powers. The wizard can now pick up and manipulate enemies as if he was a Force-wielding Jedi, while the thief will have the ability to slow down time. Not much more is known about abilities outside of this, but I'm also told that the levels are being designed to require the specialties of all the classes, increasing the importance of their powers. \n\nKey Features:\n\nPhysics-based puzzles with fire, water, gravity and magic\nAccessible for both casual and hardcore gamers\nOnline and local co-op with up to three players\nSave anywhere to play as long or short sessions as you like\nUnlimited Character Mode adds to additional replay value\nSuperb graphics with next-gen visuals use impressive technical effects\nHidden collectibles for extra adventuring\nUpgrade your characters to suit your play style and to learn amazing new skills\nFun and challenging achievements to unlock\nCurrent and New Game+ to ensure that adventuring will never end\n mazing 19-track soundtrack composed by the acclaimed Ari Pulkkinen\n\nOS: Windows 7 / Vista / XP\nProcessor: 2.0 GHz CPU (Dual Core recommended)\nMemory: 1 GB\nHard Disk Space: 1.5 GB\nVideo Card: ATi Radeon HD 2400 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 or better (Shader Model 3.0 needs to be supported)\nDirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®: 9.0c\nSound: DirectX 9.0c compatible\nAdditional: *Please note that Trine 2 may not run on most Intel graphics solutions used in 2004-2009. \nThe game does run on new (2010-) Intel HD Graphics 3000 or better.\n\nP2P group ALI213 released the BETA of the game Trine 2 for PC.
