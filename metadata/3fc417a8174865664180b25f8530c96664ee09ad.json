It consists of two 45-minute &quot;features&quot; - &quot;Dynamite Hands,&quot; a black-and-white saga about a boxer, and &quot;Baxter's Beauties of 1933,&quot; a backstage musical in color. Casts are same in both films - George C. Scott, Eli Wallach, Trish Van Devere, Red Buttons, Barbara Harris, Barry Bostwick and Harry Hamlin. They also appear in phony trailers for other films, including a World War I flying-ace adventure. The films send up all manner of 30's melodramas and musicals, notably Clifford Odets' &quot;Golden Boy&quot; and the Warner Bros. musical &quot;42nd Street.&quot; So far the film has not been released on DVD in the US.
