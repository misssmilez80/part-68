The man\ndubbed 'the people's violinist' has recorded Bach concertos with the Irish Chamber Orchestra\nand with members of the Berlin Philharmonic.\n\nDiscovering something new every time he explores the composer's music, Kennedy points up\nthe parallels with jazz. Bach loved the dance forms of his own day and his music benefits\nfrom being played with emotional freedom and a keen rhythmic sense\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/hqI40.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/hqI40.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n    J.
