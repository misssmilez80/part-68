West, Harry Relis\nMusic: Michel Michelet\nCinematography by Eugene Shuftan, GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nther Senftleben\nEditing: Robert Swink\nArt Direction: Isabella Schlichting, Werner Schlichting\nSpecial Effects: Tom Howard, Augie Lohman, Lee Zavitz\nProduced by Frank King, Herman King\nDirected by Byron Haskin\n\nWith: Guy Williams (Captain Sindbad), Heidi BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hl (Princess Jana), Pedro ArmendÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡riz (El-Carim), Abraham Sofaer (Galgo), Bernie Hamilton (Quinius), Helmuth Schneider (Bendar), Margaret Jahnen (Lady-in-Waiting), Rolf Wanka (The King), Walter Barnes (Rolf), James Dobson (Iffritch), Maurice Marsac (Ahmed), Henry Brandon (Col. Kabar), John Crawford (Aram), Geoffrey Toone (Mohar) \n\nSynopsis: In the peaceful kingdom of Baristan, Galgo the magician works in his scientific laboratory, making clouds to water his plants. The beautiful Princess Jana visits, and Galgo conjures up the image of her true love, the brave Captain Sindbad, who has just completed another exciting adventure.\n\nThe evil ruler of the kingdom, El-Carim, plans to capture his rival, Sindbad, as soon as he arrives back on land. The Princess convinces Galgo to turn her into a small bird, so that she may fly off to warn Sinbad of the trap set against him. The Princess undresses as Galgo prepares the potion. The Princess flies off just as Galgo is found out by guards, and taken to El-Carim.\n\nSindbad and his crew sail onward, and the Princess-Firebird soon arrives. But before she can give her beloved her message, El-Carim makes Galgo send guards, transformed into human falcons, to drop rocks onto Sindbad's ship sinking it.\n\nNow thinking that Sindbad is dead, El-Carim and makes Galgo turn the Princess back into a beautiful woman, for he wants to marry her himself. However, Sindbad and some of his crew have survived, and they carefully make their way to shore.\n\nWhile imprisoned, Galgo invents a paint brush which makes things grow. He makes his arm stretch out to an enormous length, long enough to grab El-Carim's magic ring, but the villain wakes up in time to burn Galgo's hand.\n\nFinally inside the city walls, Sindbad decides that he must kill El-Carim, so that the kingdom may once again be happy, and he can have the Princess for his own. He manages to get arrested, and soon appears before the dictator as a petty thief. El-Carim is not fooled, and knows that the man standing before him is the Princess' suitor, and orders him executed.\n\nHowever, Sindbad breaks free of his ropes and challenges the ruler to a fair fight. Sindbad stabs the King in the heart with a sword, but as El-Carim has no heart, he cannot be killed! El-Carim removes the sword from his chest, to everyone's horror. The mad ruler decides to put Sindbad to death the next day, in the public arena.\n\nMeanwhile, Galgo grants the depressed Princess a three-minute fantasy in which she marries her true love, Sindbad. Soon, the poor prisoner is tossed into the arena, where he must do battle with &quot;The Thing,&quot; a fearsome giant monster that is all the more deadly, as it is invisible! Fortunately, the Thing knocks over a torch, starting a fire in the arena which incites a mass exodus, allowing Sindbad to escape.\n\nSindbad visits Galgo, who tries to avoid being questioned by turning into various animals. Finally, Sindbad convinces Galgo to tell him the secret of El-Carim's invincible rule: the madman has had his heart removed, and it is kept safe in a distant bell tower, guarded by unspeakable horrors!\n\nEl-Carim insists that the Princess marry him, but she refuses, and so is slated for execution.\n\nSindbad and his men traverse the swamps of horror in order to reach the tower of the evil heart. They encounter carnivorous vines, prehistoric monsters, volcanic lava pits and water funnels on the way, finally battling an awesome, multi-headed dragon. When they reach the tower, the men cannot figure out how to reach the top of the tall, tall parapet. With the aid of a hook, Sindbad begins to climb the immense rope to the top of the tower.\n\nMeanwhile, the Princess heads ever closer to her execution. She is secured in a stockade in preparation for beheading, just as Sindbad reaches the top of the tower, and finds El-Carim's gruesome beating heart encased in crystal. The heart is protected by a fearsome giant hand, which chases Sindbad all around the bell tower.\n\nSindbad throws the hook at the crystal, which dislodges the evil heart, giving El-Carim a heart attack. Sindbad then manages to vanquish the monster hand. El-Carim and Galgo fly in a winged chariot towards the tower. Sindbad is about to impale the evil heart when El-Carim arrives on the scene. The two have a fierce swordfight while Galgo steals the wretched heart, and tosses it over the side of the tower. As it falls to the ground, El-Carim faints, and falls to his death. \n\nSoon, the entire kingdom is having a gay celebration for the marriage of their two favorite people, the Princess and Captain Sindbad. As she kisses her prince, the Princess realizes that this wedding is exactly like the dream she had earlier, but Galgo corrects her: &quot;That was not a dream. That was prophecy!&quot;\n\nTHE END\n\n\nCAPTAIN SINDBAD is a marvelous fantasy film of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œArabian NightsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ variety, with sweeping scope, fantastic special effects, marvelous sets and engaging if clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© characters. One wonders why this big budget production, filmed in Germany, suffered the fate of being tossed in with many inferior fantasy-adventures of the period.\n\nHero Guy Williams, star of TVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ZORRO, would soon become a familiar icon to every baby-boomer household as John Robinson on Irwin AllenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fantastic TV series LOST IN SPACE. Here, he plays a vacuous yet charismatic soldier of fortune. The German Heidi Bruhl is pretty but nondescript as the Princess. Our favorite was Abraham Sofour as Galgo, the wily magician.\n\nThe strength of SINDBAD lies in its elaborate and well-done array of special effects, ranging from stunning opticals to wonderful miniatures to realistic full-scale props. The hydra-head dragon, very similar to the same yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Japanese creation GHIDRAH, THE THREE-HEAD MONSTER, and an evil giant fist are standouts. Also impressive is an invisible beast, who we see only as giant footprints and green smoke. It is very reminiscent of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ monster from MGMÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s science-fiction blockbuster, FORBIDDEN PLANET.\n\nProduced by the King Brothers, who also brought us the giant monster epic GORGO, SINDBAD was directed by Byron Haskin, famous for other terrific fantasy films such as WAR OF THE WORLDS (the good one), CONQUEST OF SPACE and ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS, all George Pal productions, with which SINDBAD shares a definite look.\n\nThe name of the film is curious. One wonders if MGM was unable to obtain certain copyrights to the name, which would seem to reside in the public domain, and so added the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to SinbadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name in the promotional materials. Everyone calls him ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSinbadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ anyway! The musical score borrows melodies from Rimsky-KorsakovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œScheherazadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and BorodinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPolivetsian Dances,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ both to good effect.\n\nTerrific, worth seeking out, and far better than the dreary Columbia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSinbadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ movies which had idiosyncratic Ray Harryhausen effects, but absolutely no heart. CAPTAIN SINDBAD has heart, and then some! \n\nA/V INFO:\n=========\nGeneral\n-------\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 465 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 764 Kbps\nWriting application              : MEncoder 2:1.0~rc2-0ubuntu19+medibuntu1\nWriting library                  : MPlayer\n\nVideo\n-----\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 2\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nBit rate                         : 665 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 404 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.091\nStream size                      : 405 MiB (87%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 85.7 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 52.2 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 452 ms\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlayback Guide For DVD/CD Player: This file can be played with any DIVX/MP4 compatible DVD/VCD Player.
