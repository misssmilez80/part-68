It includes the &quot;4th Hour&quot; with Pat &amp; Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).\n\nRegarding yesterday's 4th hour: It is STILL not available either on the podcast subscription (it doesn't download - just a placeholder) or on the website.  I didn't listen to the show live yesterday, so maybe Pat &amp; Stu got up to something they don't want available for download.  Anyway, it remains unavailable today. If it comes up later this week, I will post it. (Now *I* really want to hear what they did yesterday!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b39c53aff1d8b73d3246536fa772778013a0b9b2","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+2011-10-18+%28Official+Podcast+incl.+4th+hour%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b39c53aff1d8b73d3246536fa772778013a0b9b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,156,83,175,241,216,183,61,50,70,83,111,167,114,119,128,19,160,185,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
