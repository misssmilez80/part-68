WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to be talking about various things, but one thing in particular: weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be plugging The Magic of Reality. Slate had a very good one-on-one interview with Dawkins earlier this week, and I think we all agree ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ getting more copies of that book into peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heads would be an excellent idea.\n\nWhile IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m recommending books, I also just finished Sean FairclothÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Attack of the Theocrats! How the Religious Right Harms Us All-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and What We Can Do About It. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about how the religious right is corrupting the United States, with a nice collection of concrete examples of the idiocy these bozos ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ who keep getting elected! ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ represent. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re reading this blog, you know what IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m talking about, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a safe bet youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d appreciate this book.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://richarddawkins.net/audio/643598-update-audio-of-interview-with-pz-pluggin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://richarddawkins.net/audio/643598-update-audio-of-interview-with-pz-pluggin&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMore Atheist Torrents:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://feeds.feedburner.com/AtheistTorrents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://feeds.feedburner.com/AtheistTorrents&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTweet suggestions #AtheistTorrents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99700a8350b809d4d1df9f26cd90cb3992d526e2","amp;dn":"The+Michael+Slate+Show+-+Excerpt+of+the+interview+with+PZ+%40rdfrs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99700a8350b809d4d1df9f26cd90cb3992d526e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,112,10,131,80,184,9,212,209,223,159,38,205,144,203,57,146,213,38,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
