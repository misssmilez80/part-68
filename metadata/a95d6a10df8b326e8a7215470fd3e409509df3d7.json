The Toffees' last success at Anfield was a 1-0 win, as Kevin Campbell \nslotted the winner in a feisty affair that saw three men red carded. Elsewhere, \nManchester United hosted Norwich City, a side they have only dropped two points \nagainst from a possible 24 during the Premier League era. West Brom travelled to \nSunderland looking for a repeat of their 3-2 comeback victory last April, \nand Manchester City visited Ewood Park, a happy hunting ground for them in recent \nseasons with back-to-back wins.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a95d6a10df8b326e8a7215470fd3e409509df3d7","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+-+01st+October+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a95d6a10df8b326e8a7215470fd3e409509df3d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,93,106,16,223,139,50,110,138,114,21,71,15,211,228,9,80,157,243,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
