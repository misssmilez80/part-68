They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of pop music, topping the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1982. ABBA has sold over 375 million records worldwide, which made them the fourth best-selling music artists in the history of recorded music. They still sell between two to three million albums a year. ABBA was the first pop group to come from a non-English-speaking country that enjoyed consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the UK, the U.S., Canada, Ireland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The group also enjoyed significant success in Latin American markets (particularly Mexico, Chile and Argentina) and recorded a collection of their hit songs in Spanish. During the band's active years, FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltskog and Ulvaeus were a married couple, as were Lyngstad and AnderssonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“although both couples later divorced. At the height of their popularity, both relationships were suffering strain which ultimately resulted in the collapse of the Ulvaeus-FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltskog marriage in 1979 and the Andersson-Lyngstad marriage in 1981. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, these relationship changes began appearing in the group's music, as they produced more introspective lyrics with different compositions. After ABBA broke up early 1983, Andersson and Ulvaeus achieved success writing music for the stage while Lyngstad and FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltskog pursued individual solo careers with varying success. ABBA's music declined in popularity until several films, notably Muriel's Wedding and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, revived interest in the group, spawning several tribute bands. In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into the successful musical Mamma Mia! that toured worldwide. A film of the same name released in 2008 became the highest grossing film in the United Kingdom that year. The group was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 15 March 2010.\n\n.: Abba Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/2185/abbak.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/2185/abbak.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n2005 The Complete Studio Recordings\n1973 Ring Ring @320\n1974 Waterloo @320\n1975 ABBA @320\n1976 Arrival @320\n1977 The Album @320\n1979 Voulez-Vouz @320\n1980 Super Trouper @320\n1981 The Visitors @320\n2005 Rarities @320\n\nCompilation albums\n1975 Greatest Hits (30th Anniversary Edition 2006) @320\n1979 Greatest Hits Vol. 2 @320\n1982 The Singles - The First Ten Years (2 CD) @320\n1987 The Hits @320\n1989 The Love Songs @320\n1993 More ABBA Gold - More ABBA Hits @320\n2005 18 Hits @320\n2006 Number Ones UK Special Edition (2 CD) @320\n\nLive Albums\n1986 ABBA Live @320\n\nOther albums\n1994 Agnetha &amp; Frida - The Voice Of ABBA (Tributes) @320\n1994 Gold Christmas (Bootleg) @320\n1994 Greatest Hits Live (Bootleg) @320\n1994 Opus 10 (Bootleg, 2 CD) @320\n1994 Thank You For The Music (4 CD) @320\n1999 Singles Collection 1972-1982 (27 miniCD) @320\n\nOther albums - Non-English releases\n1970 Agnetha Faltskog - Som Jag @320\n1970 Lycka @320\n1980 Gracias Por La Musica @320\n1992 Oro - Grandes Exitos @320\n1993 Mas Oro - Mas ABBA Exitos @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab7da517af7024c288ea0009fa340e1c4592ee61","amp;dn":"ABBA+-+Discography+1973-2006+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab7da517af7024c288ea0009fa340e1c4592ee61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,125,165,23,175,112,36,194,136,234,0,9,250,52,14,28,69,146,238,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
