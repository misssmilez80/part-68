The band's puzzling habit of releasing some of their best songs out of the country creates plenty of annoyance for fans in the US.\n\nThis goes out to all the Jimmy Eat World fans that would undoubtedly buy these tracks in a heartbeat if they were on iTunes. They might even consider importing the full albums if that was remotely feasible. (Navigating Japanese-language websites, which do not take US credit cards, in order to find an out of print album? Fun times.)\n\n\n\nSparkle                        - Futures (Japanese Import)\nWhen I want                    - Futures (UK/Japanese Import)\nYou                            - Futures (Japanese Import)\nWork (acoustic)                - Futures (Japanese Import)\nThe Concept                    - Futures (Japanese Import)\nShame                          - Futures (UK/Japanese Import)\nYou (demo)                     - Futures (Japanese Import)\nAnais                          - Invented (Japanese Import)\nOpen Bar Reception             - Chase This Light (Japanese Import)\nDistraction                    - Chase This Light (UK/Japanese Import)\nBe Sensible                    - Chase This Light (Japanese Import)\nBeautiful Is                   - Chase This Light (Japanese Import)\n\nBonus Track\nAlways Be (acoustic)           - Chase This Light (Unknown)\n\n\n\nThe bonus track on this torrent is a very rare acoustic version of Always Be. So rare in fact, that I could find almost no information about the song. It is not a live performance, was never released as a single, and hasn't appeared on any albums. The track is a bit of a mystery, but don't let that distract you from enjoying it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecad303e1c6e6317c72ea15b14d867b4411c60fc","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Eat+World+-+Imported+Deluxe+Tracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecad303e1c6e6317c72ea15b14d867b4411c60fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,173,48,62,28,110,99,23,199,46,161,91,20,216,103,180,65,28,96,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
