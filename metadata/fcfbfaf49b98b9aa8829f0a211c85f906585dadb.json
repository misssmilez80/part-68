I was having some trouble with the Revenge of the Fallen conversion, so that will come later. Since this 3D release won't be out for some time, I thought I would throw this conversion out there.\n\nUsual package from me... Encoded from a standard Bluray using 4.1 progressive profile, H264 video, AC3 audio, MKV container.\n\n2D to 3D conversion was made using DVDFab \n\n3D picture is 1080P when combined from Side-by-Side format.\n\nPlease no comments on seeding, I know it's slow. When you have 1 seeder and 40 leechers, that tends to happen. I have 5mb upload on a good day, and only 2mb is allocated for torrents.\n\nAlso no comments on this not being as good as what you saw in the theater.... I know, that's why it's a conversion.\n\nAnyways, enjoy and seed please. I can't start new torrents if I'm the only seeder for the old ones.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcfbfaf49b98b9aa8829f0a211c85f906585dadb","amp;dn":"Transformers+3+_+Dark+of+the+Moon+%282D+Bluray+to+3D+Conversion+SB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcfbfaf49b98b9aa8829f0a211c85f906585dadb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,251,250,244,155,152,185,170,136,41,240,162,17,200,95,144,101,133,218,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
