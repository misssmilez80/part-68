It wasn't really \nany more violent than the average episode.\n\nAs one of the longer delays in TV history while a series \nwas still in production, it didn't finally air until 3 years later. \nSo that's the reason Candy is in the episode, the photography, \nediting, and music are different, and Joe's hair is shorter.\n\nThe only thing that changed is the 9th Season theme (the last \nwith the version heard since the beginning of the series) was replaced \nby the 12th Season one to fit in with the other episodes that year.\n\nDavid Canary who played ranch foreman Candy from the 9th through \n11th Seasons, was billed as a &quot;Special Guest Star&quot;. He returned \nto the series in 1972 for the 14th Season following Dan Blocker's death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:878ac40a0a3c91d53e13a5c4db1a3b7429d67bb7","amp;dn":"BONANZA+--+Kingdom+of+Fear+%28+filmed+in+1968+%3B+aired+in+1971+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"878ac40a0a3c91d53e13a5c4db1a3b7429d67bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,138,196,10,10,60,145,213,62,19,165,196,219,26,59,116,41,214,123,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
