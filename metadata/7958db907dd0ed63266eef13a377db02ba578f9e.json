There she delivered a batch of Cyndi Lauper-meets-Postal Service-meets-Daft Punk dorm room anthems that were pleasantly catchy. Two years later, Siberia showcases singer/songwriter Valerie Poxleitners more mature, sonically sophisticated approach to her synth-driven melodic pop that draws on such dance-sympathetic styles as dubstep, hip-hop, and electronica. Where before Lights keyboards plinked and percolated like tiny bubbles popping with a soft, twee-like exuberance, here she slams you with overdriven, fuzz-pulsing synth and drum machine-driven tracks that, aside from Poxleitners angelic vocals, have an almost purposefully lo-fi sound. \n\nReleased: October 4, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Pop, Alternative\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~920 kbps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
