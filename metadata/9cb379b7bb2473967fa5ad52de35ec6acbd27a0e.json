Although the stage was small, the music let loose from it couldn't have been contained by the largest of stadiums. With a burning fire inside, the band unleashed a smoking triumvirate of tunes to light this firecracker of a show. Brand New Angel, Perfect Shelter and Streamline Woman were still smoldering in our ears as Larger Than Life melted into If 6 Was 9 and then back into Larger Than Life. Get Out Of My Life Woman fanned the flames of Birth Of The Mule and Temporary Saint and while Creep was brief respite from this white hot set, Trampled Underfoot burned the stage down to end the set. After a cooling off period in the crisp Kansas air, the band returned for set two and brought along a Patchwork Quilt to smother any embers that remained. However, the band went right into an incendiary Helter Skelter which only served as fuel for the melding of Hunger Strike and Dear Mr. Fantasy which followed. Silent Scream was intense and was both the lead into and follow up to Drums. Like Flies grooved all the way into the set closing Mule which prompted the crowd into such applause that the band returned and delivered both Champagne &amp; Reefer and Gonna Send You Back To Georgia as the evening's encore. \n\nGov't Mule\nGranada Theater\nLawrence, KS\n02.11.09 \n\nMULETRACKS [320k MP3]\n\nDISC ONE\n1.
