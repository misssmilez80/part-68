Drama. Anticipation. Exultation. Experience it all as you join the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity for an awe-inspiring journey to the surface of the mysterious red planet. Through the eyes of these two intrepid, state-of-the-art rovers, and with NASA scientists and engineers at your side, you'll see Mars in a way no one ever has before. You'll feel what it's like to stand on the startling surface of the planet that's intrigued mankind for eons. ROVING MARS -- It's the ride of a lifetime.\n\n\n\nWhen you consider the odds against success, the achievements on glorious display in Roving Mars are almost miraculous. This excellent IMAX production follows the familiar IMAX format; at 40 minutes in length, it's not as wide-ranging as other documentaries might be, but in chronicling the design, launch, and successful landings of NASA's robotic Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, it offers an unprecedented level of visual splendor, highlighted by amazingly accurate computer-animated depictions of what really happened when the rovers arrived at their destination. \n\n\nFinanced by Disney, and combining the talents of veteran IMAX director George Butler and top-ranking Hollywood producer Frank Marshall (best known for his frequent collaborations with Steven Spielberg), this celebration of science and technology begins with a raspy introduction narrated by Paul Newman (who had recently voiced the character of &quot;Doc&quot; in Disney/Pixar's Cars), then dives right into the formidable challenge of launching and landing the rovers on time and budget, with a looming deadline of optimal Mars/Earth orbital alignment occurring only once every 26 months.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction by : Paul Newman\n=============================\n\n\nNarrated by : George Butler\n===========================\n\n\nDirected by: George Butler\n==========================\n\n\n\nWritten by: George Butler &amp; Robert Andrus\n=========================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Roving Mars\nYear.................:    2006\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:39:56\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3 \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    720x400\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2385 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (External English + Swedish)\nFile Size:...........:    681 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2006\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436595/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436595/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: External ( English + Swedish) included.\n=============================================\n\n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      **** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click \n\non DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s) \n\ninstead,thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72cee6d7434f948e9107552b3f786b39e4c3f296","amp;dn":"Roving+Mars-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72cee6d7434f948e9107552b3f786b39e4c3f296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,206,230,215,67,79,148,142,145,7,85,43,63,120,107,57,228,195,242,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
