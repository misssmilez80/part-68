Of course, Bertie's plans\nare destined to &quot;strew ruin and desolation&quot; in the manner of Attila\nthe Hun, as his Aunt Dahlia suggests. Jonathan Cecil reads the story\nwith a fine ear for comic wordplay and absurdity, giving fitting caricatured\nvoices to the likes of Fink-Nottle and Glossop. He gives Wooster's first-person\nnarrative the right balance, letting the bumbling hero misread situations\nas needed. The chaos builds toward a crescendo of levity that will be\na favorite among Wodehouse fans. J.A.S.

Meanwhile, Bertie's\neccentric Aunt Dahlia asks him to hand out prizes at the Market Snodsbury\nGrammar School, which he's sure he would have to get drunk to do. Complicating\nmaters, Madeline invites Gussie to stay at her friend's house in the\ncountry. The friend turns out to be Bertie's cousin Angela and the house\n- Aunt Dahlia's. Thinking things have definitely gotten out of hand,\nBertie takes Jeeves off the case, acting on his own plan to bring Gussie\nand Madeline together. But when things go disastrously wrong, who can\nBertie turn to but Jeeves? Acclaimed actor Ian Carmichael brings comic\nflair to this rollicking tale by the man The Times (London) called a\n&quot;brilliantly funny writer.&quot;\n\nAbout the Author\nP. G.
