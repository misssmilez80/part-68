Not sure whether to upload this in TV documentaries or movies. It's a bonus or extra or supplement to a movie, but never got a separate release itself.\n\nIt's rare for movies to have documentaries longer than the movies themselves. Most 'extras' you find on DVDs/Blu-Rays are short PR-puff pieces with actors saying how wonderful it all was interspersed with trailer footage.\nHowever Ridley Scott, David Fincher and Peter Jackson have embraced the DVD/Blu-Ray format and the notion of feature-length documentaries. Unfortunately, James Cameron and Steven Spielberg haven't.\n\nThis is the 7-part, 3 hour &amp; 16 minute documentary of Gladiator (2000) starring Russell Crowe and directed by Ridley Scott. It's quite comprehensive - covering pre-production, production, and post-production, including the famous score.\n\n[Note: The aspect-ratio jumps between 4:3 of the behind-the-scenes footage and the examples from the movie in widescreen, so DVDFab was a little thrown-off with this. If you force your player to be in 16:9, it plays fine. Otherwise, in auto-aspect ratio mode, there's a slight elongation during the 4:3 scenes]\n\nIf there's sufficient interest in this, I can upload some other feature-length (i.e. 2 and 3 hour behind-the-scenes) documentaries to films such as King Kong (2005), Aliens Quadrilogy, and Blade Runner.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7531c7fe2aee91adfd094961d0b8ef1590fdd815","amp;dn":"Strength+%26amp%3B+Honour+-+The+Making+of+Gladiator+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7531c7fe2aee91adfd094961d0b8ef1590fdd815","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,49,199,254,42,238,145,173,253,9,73,97,208,184,239,21,144,253,216,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
