What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 9 - Tuesday - The winner of this week's Heston Mega Invention Test, gets the added reward of competing in an immunity challenge. Up against the winning contestant is a 1-hat chef Tomislav Martinovic. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9987a76263a166c8304b98031f64c9c053cb091c","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E51.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9987a76263a166c8304b98031f64c9c053cb091c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,135,167,98,99,161,102,200,48,75,152,3,31,100,201,192,83,203,9,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
