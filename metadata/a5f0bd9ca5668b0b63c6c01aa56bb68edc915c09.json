With massive internal injuries, he can feel his life slipping away until two identical angels appear above him, setting off an unbelievable series of events. Then, 8-year-old Emaleigh Shelt and her family scramble for cover in a hallway as a furious F4 tornado bears down on their house. But as the massive twister lifts the building off its foundation, Emaleigh sees a glowing figure covering them with giant wings shielding them from harm. Plus, after a full day of searching for Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, Army Spc. Ethan Anderson and his squad bunker down for the night. As he sleeps, Ethan has a vivid dream of his late grandfather, who tells him he must wake up right now ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ just seconds before enemy fighters open fire on his camp.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5f0bd9ca5668b0b63c6c01aa56bb68edc915c09","amp;dn":"Angels+Among+Us+S01E02+WS+DSR+XviD-OMiCRON+%5BTVRx%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5f0bd9ca5668b0b63c6c01aa56bb68edc915c09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,240,189,156,165,102,139,11,99,198,192,26,165,107,182,142,220,145,92,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
