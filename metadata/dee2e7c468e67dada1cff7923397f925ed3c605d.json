His book, originally in German, was a major event that reverberates to this day. Even though many people will find his conclusions objectionable, the book needs to be on the shelf of any serious Bible scholar. This edition is based on the first English edition, translated by W. Montgomery.    In this book, Schweitzer traces the historical progress of Historical Jesus research, from Hermann Reimarus in the mid 18th century, to William Wrede at the turn of the 20th. Schweitzer showed how Jesus\\\\\\' image had changed with the times and with the personal proclivities of the various authors. He concludes with his own synopsis and interpretation of what had been learned over the course of the previous century. He took the position that the life of Jesus must be interpreted in the light of Jesus\\\\\\' own convictions, which he characterized as those of late Jewish eschatology.\n\nPreface, by F.C.
