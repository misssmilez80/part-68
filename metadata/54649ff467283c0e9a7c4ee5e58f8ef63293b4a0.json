It has been produced by people who   \n   live and work in Silicon Valley and who have prospered with the        \n   high-tech boom of the nineties. The Internet and the personal          \n   computer, while creating Silicon Valley, have also created armies of   \n   well-paid Indian professionals who lead a curious existence: as        \n   professionals they constitute the epicenter of America's recent growth \n   binge, but as individuals they continue to stay inside cocooned,       \n   secure Indian communities which are quite divorced from all things     \n   American. A group of such engineers defies the even flow of this       \n   existence by introducing &quot;random disturbances&quot; into their lives. These \n   deviations from normal routine punctuate the film until they finally   \n   lead to a &quot;grand deviance,&quot; unthinkable for sober, law-abiding         \n   engineers from India. It is then, at the end of the film, that they    \n   discover simple solutions to seemingly complex problems in their       \n   lives.                                                                 \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                    \n                                                                \n                                                           \n                                                                       \n                                                            \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n         Previous movie included the extras after the credits enjoy       \n        this rerip, and extras to come!
