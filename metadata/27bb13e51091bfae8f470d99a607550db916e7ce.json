It's like very short freeze frames, and then the film resumes, without showing the &quot;missing&quot; frames, so there's a little jump in the action. This is not due to the encoding, since the problem is already present on the original dvd. Moreover, I've been told by someone who has seen it, that this problem is even present in the restored 35mm print of the film.&quot;\n\nThe source has been auto-cropped to take out unnecessary black space on the top, bottom, and sides.\n\nEncoded with Handbrake 0.9.5\nRuntime: 1:48:23\t\nContainer: MKV\nVideo Codec: H.264 (x264)\nFrame Rate: 23.97 FPS (Same as Source)\nConstant Quality: RF 20\nSource: 720x480\nResolution: 712x364 (auto-cropped)\nAnamorphic:  843x364 Strict\nAudio Track: Korean (2.0 channels)\nMixdown: Stereo\nAudio Codec: AAC Core Audio\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbps\nAudio Samplerate: 48000 Hz\nSubtitles: Korean, English, Japanese\nPicture Settings: Decomb-Default\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/geomeun_meori/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/geomeun_meori/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.koreafilm.org/feature/100_36.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.koreafilm.org/feature/100_36.asp&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease rate and comment!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27bb13e51091bfae8f470d99a607550db916e7ce","amp;dn":"Black+Hair+%5B1964%5D+Lee+Man-Hee+MKV+X264+AAC%40128+2.0ch+Stereo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27bb13e51091bfae8f470d99a607550db916e7ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,187,19,229,16,145,191,174,143,71,13,153,166,7,85,13,185,22,231,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
