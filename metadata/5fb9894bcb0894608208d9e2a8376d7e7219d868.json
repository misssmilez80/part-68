They have only 1 choice - to make peace with the Federation, which will mean an end to 70 years of conflict. Captain James T. Kirk and crew are called upon to help in the negotiations because of their &quot;experience&quot; with the Klingon race. Peace talks don't quite go to plan, and eventually Kirk and McCoy are tried and convicted of assassination, and sent to Rura Penthe, a snowy hard-labor prison camp. Will they manage to escape ? And will there ever be peace with the Klingons ?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102975/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102975/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb9894bcb0894608208d9e2a8376d7e7219d868","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+-+Undiscovered+Country+%281991%29%28HD%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb9894bcb0894608208d9e2a8376d7e7219d868","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,185,137,75,203,8,148,96,130,8,217,226,168,55,109,126,114,25,216,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
