I've split the series into two torrents to make it easier to ul and so everyone doesn't have to wait two days.\nSigil is Crossgen's premier sci-fi series:\nThe bulk of Sigil takes place on and around the worlds of the Planetary Union, a group of five human-inhabited planets: Gaia (believed to be humanity's homeworld), Brejhur, Delassia, Kayseecay, and Victor. Humans have also colonized the neutral world of Tanipal, which seceded from the Union some time before the series opened. Tanipal is ruled by the Sultan Ronolo.\n\nAs the series opens, the Planetary Union has been at war with the Saurians, a starfaring race of reptilian humanoids, for several centuries. The size of the saurian empire is never revealed in the series, but its capital is the saurian homeworld, Tcharun.\n\nThe series was recently relaunched by Marvel, but apparently very different from the original","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56a50c48e835c560d94506e5d71687d3e148bd18","amp;dn":"Sigil+v1+1-21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56a50c48e835c560d94506e5d71687d3e148bd18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,165,12,72,232,53,197,96,217,69,6,229,215,22,135,211,225,72,189,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
