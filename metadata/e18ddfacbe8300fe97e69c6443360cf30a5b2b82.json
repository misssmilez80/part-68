He gets married to Abidha (Roma), a young Muslim woman from a village in Kerala. Sameer, who works as a sweeper with the Alappuzha Municipality, is always on tenterhooks because he is on the police radar whenever there is trouble or an act of terror occurs. Later it is revealed that his brother-in-law Shahjahan (Unni Mukundan) was suspected to be part of the terror team that had planted bombs in Bombay in 1993 and was later killed in an encounter with the Army in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe narrative moves back and forth, slowly connecting Sameer with Shahjahan who had gone to Bombay as an IT professional, from whom much was expected by his family. The innocent youngster gets entangled in the web of a terror group and goes into hiding fearing the safety of his loved ones. Sameer and Abidha have premonitions about the bomb blasts, which change the course of their lives forever.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n[IMG]http://img257.imageshack.us/img257/3879/nqlk4aad050676008.png[/IMG]\n\nDirected by...............\tBabu Janardhan\nProduced by............... \tHaneef Muhammed\nWritten by............. \tBabu Janardhanan\nStarring............... \tMammootty,Roma,Unni Mukundan\nMusic by............... \tSongs:Afzal Yusuf,Background score:Prashant Pillai\nCinematography......... \tVipin Mohan\nEditing by............. \tVijay Shankar\nStudio................. \tRed Rose Creations\nDistributed by......... \tRed Rose Release\nRelease date(s)........ \tJune 30, 2011 (2011-06-30)[1]\nCountry................ \tIndia\nLanguage............... \tMalayalam\n\n\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 1.45GB\nDuration                         : 2h 06mn\nSourse                           : DVD9 @ MDR\nTotal bit rate                   : 1637 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 304 pixels\nFrame rate                       : 23 fps\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                           : AC3\nChannel(s)                       : 5.1 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48 KHz\n\n\n\nscreen shots\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.shotpix.com/images/47336268229749293644.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.shotpix.com/images/71698381210960435623.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.shotpix.com/images/18106614763945873058.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.shotpix.com/images/18338850416781284896.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://www.shotpix.com/images/80687562185361445908.png[/IMG]\n\n\nCredits -  MDR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e18ddfacbe8300fe97e69c6443360cf30a5b2b82","amp;dn":"Bombay+March+12+%282011%29+DVDRip+-+XviD+-+AC3+5.1+-+ESubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e18ddfacbe8300fe97e69c6443360cf30a5b2b82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,141,223,172,190,131,0,254,151,230,156,100,67,54,12,243,10,91,43,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
