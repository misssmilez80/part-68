It supports files and archives \nup to 8,589 billion gigabytes in size. It also offers the ability to create \nselfextracting and multivolume archives. With recovery record and recovery volumes, \nyou can reconstruct even physically damaged archives.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âº   Technical   Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âº\n \nTitle:\t        WinRAR 4.10 Beta 1 (32-bit)\nFilename:\twrar41b1.exe\nFile size:\t1.43MB (1,504,586 bytes)\nRequirements:\tWindows 9x / 2000 / XP / 2003 / Vista / Windows7\nLanguages:\ten-US\nLicense:\tShareware\nDate added:\tOctober 4, 20111\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle:\t        WinRAR 4.10 Beta 1 (64-bit)\nFilename:\twinrar-x64-41b1.exe\nFile size:\t1.56MB (1,634,173 bytes)\nRequirements:\tWindows XP64 / Vista64 / Windows7 64\nLanguages:\ten-US\nLicense:\tShareware\nDate added:\tOctober 4, 2011\n\n\n  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âº   log.        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âº\n\n* WinRAR can create ZIP archives of practically any size.\n- 2 GB archive size and 65535 file number ZIP limitations of previous WinRAR versions \nare not valid anymore.\n* WinRAR can create multivolume ZIP archives, which are also known as split ZIP files.\n- ZIP volumes have names like 'volname.zip', 'volname.z01', 'volname.z02'.\n- Use a volume with &quot;.zip&quot; file extension in all archive processing operations \nlike starting extraction or opening an archive.\n- Unlike RAR volumes, ZIP volumes cannot be self-extracting.\n- WinRAR needs to have access to all ZIP volumes of multivolume file set at the \nsame time, when creating or unpacking them. So it is impossible to create or unpack \nZIP volumes on removable disks, one volume per disk. You need to create them all in \nthe same folder.\n* Added the high precision file time support in ZIP archives.\n- WinRAR can store and extract modification, creation and last access file time in\nZIP archives with 100 nanosecond precision.\n- You need to set &quot;High precision modification time&quot; option in &quot;Time&quot; part of \narchiving dialog to store all 3 times in archive.\n- Set appropriate &quot;File time&quot; options in &quot;Advanced&quot; part of extraction dialog to \nchoose times to extract.\n* Added support for Unicode names stored in ZIP extra field data. \n- Different ZIP tools store Unicode names either in file header or in ZIP extra \nfield and now WinRAR can correctly process both types of Unicode names.\n* &quot;Synchronize archive contents&quot; option and -as command line switch are supported \nin ZIP format.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2d57a51882a44c32ef27824a0d301936f6230af","amp;dn":"Winrar+v4.10++%5BWin+32+Bit+%26amp%3B+64+Bit%5D+Full+Version+-+%7BRedDrago","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2d57a51882a44c32ef27824a0d301936f6230af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,213,122,81,136,42,68,195,46,242,120,36,160,211,1,147,111,98,48,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
