With Sebastian Vettel having wrapped up the drivers' championship thanks to his third-placed finish in Japan, the rest of the field will have their sights firmly set on second place. Jenson Button currently holds that position after taking maximum points at Suzuka, but Fernando Alonso is just eight points behind him. Alonso won the inaugural race here last year, beating McLaren's Lewis Hamilton and his Ferrari team-mate Felipe Massa into second and third place respectively.
