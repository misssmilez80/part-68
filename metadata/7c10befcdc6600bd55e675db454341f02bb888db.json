The two brothers (Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo) live in Manhattan and are chasing Princess Daisy (Samantha Mathis), who wears a necklace made from a meteor fragment. Its powers can free a race of reptilian creatures from the city's sewers. The villainous ruler of the creatures, who are descendants of dinosaurs, is King Koopa (Dennis Hopper). Koopa has kidnapped Daisy and taken her to the underworld of Dinohattan, which is rat-infested and strewn with garbage. The Mario Brothers must overcome many obstacles, just as they do in video games, to free the princess. The film spares no expense with its use of animatronic monsters and high-tech special effects. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 44 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 480\n\nFrame Height: 264\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c10befcdc6600bd55e675db454341f02bb888db","amp;dn":"Super+Mario+Bros.%281993%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c10befcdc6600bd55e675db454341f02bb888db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,16,190,252,220,102,0,189,85,230,117,219,69,67,65,240,43,184,136,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
