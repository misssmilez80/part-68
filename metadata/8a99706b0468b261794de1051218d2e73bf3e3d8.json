The music from the Coen brothers' Depression-era film taps into the source from which the purest strains of country, blues, bluegrass, folk, and gospel music flow. Producer T Bone Burnett enlists the voices of Alison Krauss, Gillian Welch, Emmylou Harris, Ralph Stanley, and kindred spirits for performances of traditional material, in arrangements that are either a cappella or feature bare-bones accompaniment. Highlights range from the aching purity of Krauss's &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; to the plainspoken faith of the Whites' &quot;Keep on the\nSunny Side&quot; to Stanley's chillingly plaintive &quot;O Death.&quot; The album's spiritual centerpiece finds Krauss, Welch, and Harris harmonizing on &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby,&quot; a gospel lullaby that sounds like a chorus of Appalachian angels. --Don McLeese\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.James carter &amp; the prisoners - po lazarus            [04:31]\n02.Harry mclintock - big rock candy mountain            [02:18]\n03.Norman blake - you are my sunshine                   [04:28]\n04.Alison krauss - down in the river to pray            [02:56]\n05.Soggy bottom boys - I am A man of constant sorrow    [03:10]\n06.Chris thomas king - hard time killing floor blues    [02:42]\n07.Norman blake - man of constant sorrow                [04:29]\n08.Whites - keep on the sunny side                      [03:34]\n09.Gillian welch &amp; alison krauss - i'll fly away        [03:58]\n10.Gillian welch, alison krauss &amp; emmylou harris -      [01:58]\n     didn't leave nobody but the baby\n11.Sarah, hanna &amp; leah peasall - in the highways        [01:36]\n12.Cox family - I am weary (let me rest)                [03:14]\n13.John hartford - I am A man of constant sorrow        [02:34]\n14.Ralph stanley - O death                              [03:20]\n15.Soggy bottom boys - in the jailhouse now             [03:36]\n16.Soggy bottom boys - I am A man of constant sorrow    [04:17]\n17.John hartford - indian war whoop                     [01:30]\n18.Fairfield four - lonesome valley                     [04:07]\n19.Stanley brothers - angel band                        [02:16]\n____\n\n60:34 min\n 70,9 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
