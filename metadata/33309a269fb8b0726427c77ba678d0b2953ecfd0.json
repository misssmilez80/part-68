What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 10 - Sunday - Buongiorno, from Italy! Tonight our top 10 contestants join the judges in Rome for a week of challenges! But this is no Roman holiday, tonight they must cook a Roman dish that has a story to tell. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33309a269fb8b0726427c77ba678d0b2953ecfd0","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E55.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33309a269fb8b0726427c77ba678d0b2953ecfd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,48,154,38,159,184,176,114,100,39,199,123,166,120,208,178,149,62,207,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
