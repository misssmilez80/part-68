This is the definitive CD edition of the classic Getz/GIlberto album, Verve Super Best series, POCJ-9202. This is the only CD to feature the original mix of the album as it was mastered in 1963: Astrud Gilberto panned hard-left, drums panned hard-right.\n\nAll tracks are ripped as-is from the CD. Some tracks, however, featured an odd ringing sound around 15.6 kHz. Perhaps someone had a TV tube on in the studio. The noise is particularly harsh on &quot;The Girl from Ipanema,&quot; and spectral analysis shows it to a lesser degree on several other tracks. So for these tracks, in addition to the directly-ripped versions, I present de-ringed versions for which I very carefully removed the harsh ringing sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c61c13c6a65923f29b6e299e2639554d9f89f0c5","amp;dn":"Getz-Gilberto+%28POCJ-9202%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c61c13c6a65923f29b6e299e2639554d9f89f0c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,28,19,198,166,89,35,242,155,110,41,158,38,57,85,77,159,137,240,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
