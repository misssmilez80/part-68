They ask the US Federal Reserve Chairman to return the money he owes someone on Twitter and they google 'Ben Bernanke' and 'Tim Geithner' to save the government some money. \n\nIn the second half of the show, Max Keiser interviews actress, comedian, producer, director and writer, Roseanne Barr, about #occupywallstreet and about her plans for bankers in a Barr administration.        \n\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
