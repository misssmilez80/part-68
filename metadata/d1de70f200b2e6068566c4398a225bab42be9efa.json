Grice (Author)\n\nHardcover: 256 pages\nPublisher: Academic Press; 1 edition (April 13, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0123851947\nISBN-13: 978-0123851949\n\nThis book introduces a new data analysis technique that addresses long standing criticisms of the current standard statistics. Observation Oriented Modelling presents the mathematics and techniques underlying the new method, discussing causality, modelling, and logical hypothesis testing. Examples of how to approach and interpret data using OOM are presented throughout the book, including analysis of several classic studies in psychology. These analyses are conducted using comprehensive software for the Windows operating system that has been written to accompany the book and will be provided free to book buyers on an accompanying website. \n\nThe software has a user-friendly interface, similar to SPSS and SAS , which are the two most commonly used software analysis packages, and the analysis options are flexible enough to replace numerous traditional techniques such as t-tests, ANOVA, correlation, multiple regression, mediation analysis, chi-square tests, factor analysis, and inter-rater reliability. The output and graphs generated by the software are also easy to interpret, and all effect sizes are presented in a common metric; namely, the number of observations correctly classified by the algorithm. The software is designed so that undergraduate students in psychology will have no difficulty learning how to use the software and interpreting the results of the analyses.\n\n* Describes the problems that statistics are meant to answer, why popularly used statistics often fail to fully answer the question, and how OOM overcomes these obstacles * Chapters include examples of statistical analysis using OOM * Software for OOM comes free with the book * Accompanying website include svideo instruction on OOM use","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1de70f200b2e6068566c4398a225bab42be9efa","amp;dn":"Observation+Oriented+Modeling%3A+Analysis+of+Cause+in+the+Behavior","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1de70f200b2e6068566c4398a225bab42be9efa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,222,112,242,0,178,230,6,133,102,196,57,138,34,91,171,66,190,158,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
