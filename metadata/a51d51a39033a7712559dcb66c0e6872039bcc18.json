Seven years\n later, as the eyes of the world are once again focused on the capital,\n '7/7: One Day in London' gathers the testimony of over 50 people directly \n affected by the bombings, exploring the long lasting effects as they reflect\n on their experiences and how their lives have changed.After the conclusion\n of the public inquest in 2011, a multitude of previously untold stories \n emerged of the bravery, difficulties and horror that people experienced\n on that day in 2005; many of these have been included in this film as well\n as testimony from people who have never spoken publically before. \n This is an ambitious retelling of the story of what happened on that day, \n with contributions from commuters, emergency service workers, TFL \n staff and families of victims. With enormous compassion for one another, \n ordinary people tell extraordinary stories of the day when they were thrown\n together, and their struggle to cope in the wake of the blasts that shook     London.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a51d51a39033a7712559dcb66c0e6872039bcc18","amp;dn":"7.7.One.Day.In.London.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a51d51a39033a7712559dcb66c0e6872039bcc18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,29,81,163,144,51,167,113,37,89,220,182,108,14,104,114,3,155,204,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
