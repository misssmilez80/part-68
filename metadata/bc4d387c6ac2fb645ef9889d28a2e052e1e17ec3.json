Contributors are an admirably international group, representing (mostly) universities in the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, and elsewhere. A large contingent is based in Hong Kong, while a handful is based in mainland China. Editor Pong states in his introduction that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe importance of the international character of this encyclopedia project cannot be overstressed.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Immediately apparent are the hundreds of high-quality photographs, maps, charts, graphs, and other illustrations (a high proportion in color). Another outstanding feature is the section, in volume 4, of 53 primary source documents ranging chronologically from a letter of advice to Queen Victoria (1839) to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCharter 08ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (2008). There are main entries for each province (including a map and a box containing key data), major cities, important people, Chinese relations with countries from Australia to Vietnam, and hundreds of miscellaneous subjects (Adoptions, Beggars, Catholicism, Dance, Long March, Monuments, Political culture since 1900, Teacher education, Weights and measures, etc.). Larger subjects (for example, Architecture, history of; Chinese overseas; Energy; River systems; Social welfare) are subdivided into articles by multiple contributors. Each entry is followed by see also references and a bibliography, mostly of books. An annotated bibliography in volume 4 describes key sources. Each volume contains a full-color physical map in the inside front cover and population density map in the inside back cover. Volume 1 includes Pong's introduction, lists of articles and contributors, a thematic outline, major chronological periods, and a chronology. Volume 4 contains Wade-Giles to Pinyin (and vice versa) conversion tables, a lengthy glossary of Chinese characters (romanized, Chinese character, and English equivalents), and a thorough index. Pong notes that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChina is now a factor to be reckoned with in practically every aspect of international life.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He adds, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt is our hope that these volumes will provide reliable and sophisticated renditions of the myriad facets of China.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Both authoritative and highly accessible, this encyclopedia is strongly recommended for academic, public, and high-school libraries. Also highly recommended is the Berkshire Encyclopedia of China (2009), which is broader in scope but also very strong on the modern period. --Craig Bunch\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 2500 pages\n    * Publisher: Charles Scribners &amp; Sons; 1 edition (July 31, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0684315661\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0684315669","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc4d387c6ac2fb645ef9889d28a2e052e1e17ec3","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Modern+China+%284+vols%29+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc4d387c6ac2fb645ef9889d28a2e052e1e17ec3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,77,56,124,106,194,251,100,94,249,136,157,40,162,224,82,225,225,126,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
