When Matt and Pedro were listening to a tune by Derek Custer (Pablo in The Uberplebs) called Warmongering (about the invasion of Iraq: http://www.mp3.com.au/track.asp?id=51313 ), they thought it would be a good idea to put the words to beats. They approached Pablo and all agreed to begin recording their take on the unfolding events in history, which is usually written by the winners.\n\nWhen you listen to their music you will find that they have exhaustively researched their subject matter and have used archive material as samples for their work, including excerpts of news reports of events such as: 9/11, 7/7, the execution of Jean Charles de Menezes and the ongoing slaughter in Iraq.\n\nThe Uberplebs are now disbanded, Plebology (2011) is their final recording.\n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41fad082d1ece883eda58ed04ef2d491b5cda411","amp;dn":"The+Uberplebs+-+Plebology+%282011%29+%2810+Tracks+-+320kbps+CBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41fad082d1ece883eda58ed04ef2d491b5cda411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,250,208,130,209,236,232,131,237,165,142,208,78,242,212,145,181,205,164,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
