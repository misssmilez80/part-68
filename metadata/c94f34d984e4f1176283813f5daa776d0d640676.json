However, even owners of both of the CD re-releases of the Royal Guardsmen's 4 albums: Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron/Snoopy &amp; His Friends and The Return of the Red Baron/Snoopy for President will want to buy one of these anthology CD's because they contain two not included singles, &quot;Mother, Where's Your Daughter?&quot; and the last Snoopy song, &quot;Smallest Astronaut&quot;. Unfortunately, the version of &quot;Snoopy For President&quot; included on these CD's is a defective one, the edited version, which cuts out the words &quot;in '68&quot;, destroying the meter of the first line in a pathetic attempt to make the song appear less dated. In order to obtain a non-butchered version of &quot;Snoopy For President&quot;, you will have to buy the second album re-release: The Return of the Red Baron/Snoopy for President. In addition, the &quot;Story of...&quot; fake radio broadcasts that precede the 3 Snoopy versus the Red Baron songs on the third album are missing. For those you must purchase either the first album re-release Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron/Snoopy &amp; His Friends or for an indefective consecutive track version, an old CD re-release of the third album: Snoopy's Merry Christmas or Snoopy's Christmas.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nOf course, the heart of this hourlong, 20-track compilation is the series of Snoopy novelty hits enjoyed by the Royal Guardsmen in the mid-'60s, starting with the million-selling &quot;Snoopy vs. the Red Baron.&quot; The group had a few other singles chart entries, all of which are here, sometimes making reference to aerial themes (&quot;Airplane Song [My Airplane]&quot;). Though cute and catchy with their martial drumming and banjo picking, the Snoopy songs have a trash-rock quality in the tradition of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and &quot;Hang On Sloopy.&quot; Elsewhere, the group veers from one mid-'60s style to another, sometimes re-creating the good-time sound of the Lovin' Spoonful, other times using harmonies that sound like the Association, then resorting to covers (an instrumental version of &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &amp; Roll Star,&quot; &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;). Though they made four albums, this best-of is a little more than anyone really needs of the Royal Guardsmen. [The Best of the Royal Guardsmen is identical in tracks and sequencing to the 1995 One Way compilation of the Royal Guardsmen, Anthology.]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c94f34d984e4f1176283813f5daa776d0d640676","amp;dn":"The+Royal+Guardsmen+-+The+Best+of+the+Royal+Guardsmen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c94f34d984e4f1176283813f5daa776d0d640676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,79,52,217,132,228,241,23,98,131,129,63,93,170,119,109,13,100,6,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
