I don't think there's a limit to how many seeds a torrent can have at hand. If there is, we better damn well reach it.\n\nHunter x Hunter chapters 1-310 setup to work beautifully with the &quot;Photos&quot; feature on the iPad.\n\nAll pages are in JPEG format. So will probably work just as well on a Kindle or Nook. If you have to ask if it works on a computer, you should probably assume its a miracle you've gotten here.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Put chapter folders in what ever folder you are syncing your ipad/ipod/whatever photo library to. Each chapter will show up in order as a photo album.\n\nOR: Just read it. \n\nFeel free to put them in any other way you want it won't mess up the order of the pages. I don't recommend putting all 5000+ pictures in 1 album though. Seems like a lot to scroll through...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:908e486681041be4a8116fb2fb3927e72fab738f","amp;dn":"Hunter+x+Hunter+1-310%28iPad%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"908e486681041be4a8116fb2fb3927e72fab738f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,142,72,102,129,4,27,228,168,17,111,178,251,57,39,231,47,171,115,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
