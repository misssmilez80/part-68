When his friend Murray is fired from the railroad and begins helping Rebstock wreck trains, Smith must go after him. He also seems to have an interest in Murray's wife (and vice versa). \n\n\nuser revue\n\nThis is a very fine western. Great Technicolor, decent acting and a nice plot. As a fan of the western genre, I appreciate the snappy way the story moves along. Modern westerns (and most films, in fact) drag the exposition out. Here, for example, when Robert Preston's character meets up with his old friend Ladd and mentions Preston's wife's name, the look on Ladd's face instantly tells you &quot;oh-oh, there's a history here.&quot; Very quick, but well done and you know what's coming.\n\nThis is a &quot;railroad western.&quot; It's nice to see a western that emphasizes the importance and power of the the railroads in the settlement of the west","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5182e3b8306084828e487336818b99927aa8d3a","amp;dn":"Whispering+Smith+%7BWestern%7D+%28Alan+Ladd%29+%5B1948%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5182e3b8306084828e487336818b99927aa8d3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,24,46,59,131,6,8,72,40,228,135,51,104,24,185,153,39,170,141,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
