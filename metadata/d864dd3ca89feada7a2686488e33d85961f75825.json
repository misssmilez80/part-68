Full of angst, Harry wanders around, not very energetically, trying to make up for 16 years of working in the numbers game. Plenty of parody and belly-gazing at latter-day Jewish society.\n\nNot much in the way of familiar faces to shake a stick at, but the faces are well placed, in a sort of creepy way.\n\nNo subtitles, but a 30 odd minute making of featurette on these\n\nUncompressed NTSC DVD5 VIDEO_TS files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d864dd3ca89feada7a2686488e33d85961f75825","amp;dn":"Michael+Roemer+-+Martin+Priest+-+The+Plot+Against+Harry+%281970%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d864dd3ca89feada7a2686488e33d85961f75825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,100,221,60,168,159,234,218,122,38,134,72,142,51,216,89,97,247,88,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
