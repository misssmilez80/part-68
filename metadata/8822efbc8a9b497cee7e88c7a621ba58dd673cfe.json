Believers and scholars are interviewed. Artwork and staged reenactments depict the end times. \n\n\nArmageddon: It is a universal theme that has spanned centuries and culturesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and has, as some say, become increasingly more relevant today.\n\n\nSurprisingly, however, a final chapter of this apocalyptic end has received little examination: the actual final battle between God and Satan, good and evil. The Bible points to a battlefield at Meggido in present day Israel, with each side taking a series of steps that will lead up to, and unfold, during this actual battle. What will this battle look like? Where do the stories come from, and how have they differed throughout history, between religions?\n\n\n\nGod vs. Satan: The Final Battle will take viewers on a tour of the final days, and moments, as envisioned by believers of the three Abrahamic religions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Avery Brooks\n=========================\n\n\n\nDirected by: Lisa Wolfinger\n===========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    God vs. Satan The Final Battle\nYear.................:    2008\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:28:36\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1103 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    698 MB\nFPS..................:    23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2008\n\n\n\n\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320258/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320258/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n    \n\n\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8822efbc8a9b497cee7e88c7a621ba58dd673cfe","amp;dn":"God+vs.+Satan+The+Final+Battle-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8822efbc8a9b497cee7e88c7a621ba58dd673cfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,34,239,188,138,155,73,124,238,126,136,199,166,33,186,88,221,103,60,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
