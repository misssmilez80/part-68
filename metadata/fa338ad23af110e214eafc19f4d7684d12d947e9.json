The entire instrumental backing is provided by The Brodsky String Quartet. Costello described the album as a song sequence for string quartet and voice and it has a title. It's a little bit different. It's not a rock opera. It's a new thing. It peaked at no.18 on the UK album chart, and at no.125 on the Billboard 200.\n\n- - -\n\nCostello first encountered the Brodsky Quartet in 1989, a performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall of the entire cycle of string quartets by Dmitri Shostakovich. They met for the first time in November 1991, to begin work on the concept and execution of this album project. Costello viewed this album as neither his first stab at classical music, nor the Brodsky's first attempt at rock and roll.\n\nWith a concept of imaginary letters being sent to an imaginary recipient, Juliet Capulet, all five musicians contributed to the writing of the lyrics as well as the music. No overdubs were made, the album recorded in its entirety live in the studio. One single was actually released from the album, the track Jacksons, Monk, and Rowe, although it did not grace the charts in either America or the UK.\n\nSeveral artists have either recorded or mounted productions of the song cycle. It was recorded by Canadian singer Kerry-Anne Katz and the Abysse String Quartet recorded the song cycle in February 2006. In September 2006, husband-and-wife duo Michelle and David Murray released a new version arranged for voice and piano by David Murray. In 2008, Jake Endres and the Theatrical Musical Company produced the first fully staged theatrical performance of The Juliet Letters, complete with two additional original songs. The production opened in September 2008 in Minneapolis at the Southern Theater. In 2009, a Polish singer-actress Katarzyna Groniec translated the whole Juliet Letters material into Polish, recorded and released it as Listy Julii with a band of trombone, saxophone, clarinet, French horn, tuba, flute, keyboards, bass guitar, and drums.
