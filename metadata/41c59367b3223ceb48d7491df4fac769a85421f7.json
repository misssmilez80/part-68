And all operations performed on the operating\n system are completely safe, because all changes are        \n monitored by TuneUp Rescue Center and can be undone at any \n time. All TuneUp Utilities modules can be accessed through \n a common interface that is divided into six categories.    \n The software helps both beginners and experts to make      \n Windows meet their needs in a way that is better, easier   \n and safer. All important system options are explained in an\n easy way and can be turned on or off at the click of your  \n mouse. TuneUp Utilities will then make the necessary       \n changes in the registry or boot files automatically. We    \n place a high value on system stability, so that Windows    \n won't stop working reliably. And most changes that you make\n can be undone in TuneUp Rescue Center - easily and safely. \n                                                            \n TuneUp Utilities automatically runs important maintenance  \n tasks for you, makes you aware of any problems and offers  \n simple solutions. This ensures performance is always at its\n best. A slow and untidy computer is now a thing of the past\n for you. You can also use TuneUp Utilities to customize the\n appearance of your Windows system - to make working on your\n computer more enjoyable.                                   \n                                                            \n With TuneUp Utilities you will quickly make your Windows   \n system faster and more convenient to use- and ensure that  \n it stays like this for the long term. This makes TuneUp    \n Utilities the perfect program for everyone: for those who  \n would rather leave the computer maintenance to a reliable  \n partner as well as for those who would rather do everything\n themselves.                                                \n                                                            \n The TuneUp Turbo Mode provides an immediate performance    \n boost whenever you need it. When you use your computer in  \n the TuneUp Turbo Mode, an analysis is performed to see     \n which tasks, programs and functions are currently running  \n in the background that are not strictly necessary. These   \n programs are stopped or slowed down, allowing the          \n additional processing power gained to be used exclusively  \n by the Programs you are actually running.                  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41c59367b3223ceb48d7491df4fac769a85421f7","amp;dn":"TuneUp.Utilities.2012.v12.0.2030.10.Incl.Keygen-Lz0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41c59367b3223ceb48d7491df4fac769a85421f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,197,147,103,179,34,60,235,72,215,73,29,244,250,199,105,168,84,33,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
