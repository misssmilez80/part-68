Lounge lizard Buddy Greco, who was a key member of \nThe Rat Pack in the 1960s, chats to Jools and plays the odd standard or two as he \nreleases a live album from the 60s which was recorded at the Sands in Las Vegas. \nAnd 21-year-old singer-songwriter from London, Lianne La Havas, makes her TV debut \narmed with her electric guitar, sweet harmonies and an incredibly soulful voice.\n\n\nCredits\n\nSeries Producer..Alison Howe\nPresenter..Jools Holland\nDirector..Janet Fraser Cook \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/73J6V.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/73J6V.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n::General::\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 581 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 1 304 Kbps\nDuration: 1h 2mn\nSample: NO\nSubtitles External: NO\n\n::Video Info::\n\nContainer: avc\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate: 1 100 Kbps\nResolution: 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16.9\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.153\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: (oan).Thanks!!\n\n::Audio Info::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 224 Kbps ((( Stereo )))\nMaximum Bitrate: 576 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels [Front: L R]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46af1f3375d25d1b25191eea89ec65685b8f22a3","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Later...+Jools+Holland+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29+Fri+21+Oct+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46af1f3375d25d1b25191eea89ec65685b8f22a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,175,31,51,117,210,93,27,37,25,30,234,137,236,101,104,91,143,34,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
