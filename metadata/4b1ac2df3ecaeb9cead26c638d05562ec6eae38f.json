The album has a very strong relation to ABBA because of the participation of Agnetha FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltskog singing duet with Tomas on Never Again. The song was recorded in both English and Spanish versions. Both versions are available on CD - the Spanish one as a bonus track. The song I Got Something, was later recorded by Frida and released on her solo album Something's Going On.
