Learn the Bible from a Hebrew mindset. Our Lord Jesus(his greek name) was called Yeshua(which means salvation) by everyone that lived in his time. To know Yeshua, we must understand that he loved the Torah. Yeshua came to fulfill the Torah not destroy Torah.\n\nThe Bible was originally written in Hebrew and later translated into Greek. There is much to be learned by what was lost in translation. Yeshua wants everyone to know him. If you want to learn truth. This is a good place to start. \n\n\n Lesson Title\n \n HaYesod, The Foundations Lesson Summary\n \n Audio Message\n \n \nOur Foundation,\nPart 1\n(Sorry, sound quality\npoor in 1st 10 minutes)\n \n The roots and foundation of our faith in Messiah: our\nconnection with the Land, the People, and the Scriptures\nof Israel.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nUnified Word of God, \nPart 2\n \n A study on &quot;progressive revelation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½seeing the unity of\ntheology and purpose from Genesis to Revelation.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nScriptures of Israel,\nPart 3\n \n Discovering the nature and purposes of the first five books\nof the Bible, the Torah.\n \n Greg Walker\n \n \nMessiah &amp; the Torah, \nPart 4\n \n Yeshua's teaching about the Scriptures of Israel.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nMessiah,\nthe Living Torah,\nPart 5\n \n How Yeshua lived out the teaching of the Torah.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nOur Identity\nin Messiah.\nPart 6\n \n What the Scriptures teach concerning who we are as believers\nin the Messiah ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a major key in combating legalism.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nThe Covenant \nConnection,\nPart 7\n \n A study on the importance of covenants.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nA Covenant \nComparison,\nPart 8\n \n See how the Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and New\nCovenants compare and relate to one another and to you.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nPaul, the\nMystery Man,\nPart 9\n \n A study on Saul of Tarsus, the Torah teacher par excellence.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nPaul, the\nMisunderstood Man,\nPart 10\n \n Rethinking many of the common is understandings that have\nbeen fostered concerning Paul's teachings about the Torah.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nThe Torah Community,\nPart 11\n \n A study on the nature of the community of Believers described\nboth in the Torah and the New Covenant Scriptures.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nThe Season\nof Our Joy,\nPart 12\n \n A study on the cycle of special times of celebration described\nin Leviticus 23.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nDivine Permission,\nPart 13\n \n The roots and foundation of our faith in Messiah: our\nconnection with the Land, the People, and the Scriptures\nof Israel.\n \n Pastor Mark\n \n \nCelebrating our \nInheritance,\nPart 14\n \n Celebrating our spiritual and physical inheritance with IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\npromised to all believers in Yeshua the Messiah.\n \n Art Palecek\n \n \n \n...to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the \nopening of the prison to them that are bound;\nIsaiah 61:1  The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath \nanointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me...\nEl  Shaddai  Ministries\n      \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed08b5b006320eb8506062bca14686554a2923db","amp;dn":"Bible+study","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed08b5b006320eb8506062bca14686554a2923db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,8,181,176,6,50,14,184,80,96,98,188,161,70,134,85,74,41,35,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
