Deal with the products of your farm and expand your machinery\n     \n    This game allows you to ride many tractors. Choose between many different\n    models of tractors, combines, extensions and hangers. Sell your products\n    and invest in better equipment. More powerful machines will help you farm\n    bigger areas. As a striving farmer, you have to invest carefully to\n    maximize the crop. Dont kick over the traces or you wont be able to\n    upgrade your farm and buy more land. Choose the right seed from different\n    types of grains like barley, rye or wheat or decide to grow canola or\n    corn. The harvest can be used as animal food or new seed as well as a\n    product to be sold on the market. Always have an eye on the market prices\n    so you don't come out with losses after all the work\n     \n    The add-on &quot;Biogas&quot; expands the features of the original game\n    &quot;Agricultural Simulator 2011&quot; by aspects of the green power generation\n    For that purpose, new expansions, crops and production cycles were added\n    to the original gameplay. Harvest special crops for energy generation and\n    transport those products to the biogas facility. In addition to the\n    energy generation a complete new hay production cycle was added\n     \n    Sounds like a lot of work. Indeed, but you can invest your hardly earned\n    money into helpers which can automatically seed and harvest your crops\n    Like that you can focus on the tasks you prefer and keep an eye on the\n    expansion of your farm. If you do not want to leave the work of real men\n    to these AI-Boys, simply enter the multiplayer mode and let your friends\n    join you.
