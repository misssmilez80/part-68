His Mexican period produced a half dozen or so films, including the classic \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Los Olvidados\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and, curiously, a pair of films adapted from English literature - a Spanish retelling of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Wuthering Heights\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and a straightforward and very good adaptation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Robinson Crusoe.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Filmed on a shoestring budget in a cheap color process that looked fuzzy even in first release, the film featured the Irish actor Dan O\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Herilhy as the castaway sailor. Tossed into grindhouses and drive-ins by its American distributor, it nevertheless brought O\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Herlihy a surprise Oscar nomination as best actor. There have been many film versions of the Defoe story before and since, but Bunuel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s film,in many ways so unlike the rest of his film work, remains the best of them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed79dac6e55b0d24805271971228da477aca7772","amp;dn":"Adventures+of+Robinson+Crusoe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed79dac6e55b0d24805271971228da477aca7772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,121,218,198,229,91,13,36,128,82,113,151,18,40,218,71,122,202,119,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
