It also contains a \nnew studio version of &quot;Hush&quot; to commemorate their 20th anniversary. \n&quot;Black Night&quot; was also re-recorded but never released. \n&quot;Hard Lovin' Woman&quot; includes parts of &quot;Under The Gun&quot; \nduring Blackmore's guitar solo. &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; \nincludes parts of Jesus Christ Superstar. \nThe album represented Deep Purple's setlist at the time, \nwhich consisted much of the typical &quot;Made In Japan (album)&quot;\n set, combined with newer material from the 1984 reunion album \nPerfect Strangers and The House of Blue Light. Songs such as \n&quot;The Unwritten Law&quot; and &quot;Difficult To Cure&quot; were played every \nnight on the tour, but were not represented on this album.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:883a8c0cbbaad5d4502382af9ca27ba2beffdc30","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+Live+Nobody%5C%27s+Perfect+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"883a8c0cbbaad5d4502382af9ca27ba2beffdc30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,58,140,12,187,170,213,212,80,35,130,175,156,162,123,162,190,255,220,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
