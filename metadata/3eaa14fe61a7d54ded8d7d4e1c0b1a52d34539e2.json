It is based on the protest activity at the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999. The film premiered on May 22, 2008 at the Seattle International Film Festival.\n\nMLK Jr. - 'MY PROBLEM IS NOT THE VIOLENT RACISTS (CORPS, PRES, CONGRESS, PRESS, ETC); MY PROBLEM IS THE GOOD PEOPLE THAT WILL NOT, DO NOT STAND UP LONG ENOUGH, WITH ENOUGH COURAGE, WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE, INTENSITY, SOLIDARITY... SO THAT GOOD WILL PREVAIL.'\n\nThis movie is an enormously serious and important look at how we need to wage all-out unviolent war to save Humanitys Mother - Earth, our Home, before life-support is totally and irreversibly destroyed.\n\nThis is the Courage we need.\nThis is the Unviolence we need.\nThis is the cleverness we need.\nThis is the Inventiveness we need.\nThis is the URGENCY we need.\nThis is the Solidarity we need.\n\n\nThe film depicts the historic protest in 1999, as thousands of activists arrive in Seattle, Washington in masses to protest the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999. The World Trade Organization is considered by protesters to contribute to widening the socioeconomic gap between the rich and the poor while it claims to be fixing it and increasing world hunger, disease and death.\n\nThe movie takes an in-depth look at several fictional characters during those five days in 1999 as demonstrators protested the meeting of the WTO in Seattles streets. The movie portrays conflicts between the peaceful protesters and a minority committing property destruction whose actions were widely covered by the media. Although the protest began peacefully with a goal of stopping the WTO talks, police began teargassing the crowd and the situation escalated into a full-scale riot and a State of Emergency that pitted protesters against the Seattle Police Department and the National Guard.\n\nCast\nThough the film is based on actual events, the characters are fictional.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Martin Henderson as Jay\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Michelle Rodriguez as Lou\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Charlize Theron as Ella\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Woody Harrelson as Dale\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Benjamin as Django\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Connie Nielsen as Jean\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ray Liotta as Mayor Jim Tobin (loosely based on real-life Seattle Mayor Paul Schell)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tTzi Ma as Governor (loosely based on former Washington Governor Gary Locke)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tChanning Tatum as Johnson\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tJennifer Carpenter as Sam\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIvana Milicevic as Carla\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tJoshua Jackson as Randall\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIsaach De BankolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© as Abasi\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tRade Serbedzija as Dr. Meric\nFilming locations\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tVancouver, British Columbia, Canada \no\tUniversity of British Columbia, Point Grey Campus\no\tGranville Square\no\tCorner of Hastings and Hornby\no\tCorner of Hastings and Howe Leone and L2\no\tFoot of Vancouver Public Library\no\tFraser Street, between 41st and 49th Avenues\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tSeattle, Washington\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eaa14fe61a7d54ded8d7d4e1c0b1a52d34539e2","amp;dn":"Battle+in+Seattle+-+Waging+All-out+Unviolent+War+for+Humanity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eaa14fe61a7d54ded8d7d4e1c0b1a52d34539e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,170,20,254,97,167,213,77,237,141,125,78,28,11,26,82,211,69,57,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
