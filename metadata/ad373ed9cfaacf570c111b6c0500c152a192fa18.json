The plot was based on the story Night Bus by Samuel Hopkins Adams, which provided the shooting title. It Happened One Night was one of the last film romantic comedies created before the MPAA began enforcing the 1930 production code in 1934. In spite of its title the movie takes place over several nights.\n\nThe film was the first to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay), a feat that would not be matched until One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and later by The Silence of the Lambs (1991). In 1993, It Happened One Night was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; It was remade twice, both as musicals: Eve Knew Her Apples (1945) starring Ann Miller,[2] and You Can't Run Away from It (1956) starring Jack Lemmon and June Allyson.\n\nPlot\n\nSpoiled heiress Ellen &quot;Ellie&quot; Andrews (Claudette Colbert) marries fortune-hunter &quot;King&quot; Westley (Jameson Thomas) against the wishes of her extremely wealthy father (Walter Connolly). He retrieves his daughter before the marriage can be consummated, but then she runs away. Boarding a bus to New York City, to reunite with her new spouse, she meets fellow bus passenger Peter Warne (Clark Gable), an out-of-work newspaper reporter. He recognizes her and gives her a choice: if she will give him an exclusive on her story he will help her reunite with Westley. If not, he will tell her father where she is and collect the reward offered for her return. Ellie agrees to the first choice.\n\nSoon penniless, Ellie has to rely completely on Peter. As they go through several adventures together, Ellie loses her initial disdain for him and begins to fall in love.\n\nWhen they have to hitchhike, Peter claims to be an expert on the subject. As car after car passes them by, he eventually ends up thumbing his nose at them. The sheltered Ellie then shows him how it's done. She stops the next car, driven by Danker (Alan Hale), dead in its tracks by lifting up her skirt and showing off a shapely leg.\n\nWhen they stop for a break, Danker tries to drive off with their luggage. Peter chases him down and takes his car.\n\nOne night, nearing the end of their journey together, Ellie confesses her love to Peter. Peter mulls over what she has said, decides he loves her too, and leaves to make arrangements after she has fallen asleep. When the owners of the motel in which they are staying notice that Peter's car is gone, they roust Ellie out of bed and kick her out.\n\nBelieving Peter has deserted her, Ellie calls her father, who is so relieved to get her back that he agrees to let her marry Westley. Although Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, she believes Peter has betrayed her for the reward money, so she agrees to have a second, formal wedding. Meanwhile, Peter has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie, but as he drives back to tell her, they pass each other on the road.\n\nEllie tries to pretend that nothing has happened, but she is unable to fool her father. She finally reveals the whole story (as she sees it).\n\nWhen Peter comes to Ellie's home, Mr. Andrews offers him the reward money, but Peter insists on being paid only his expenses: a paltry $39.60. When Ellie's father presses him for an explanation of his odd behavior, Peter admits he loves Ellie (though he thinks he is out of his mind to do so), then storms out.\n\nAt the wedding ceremony, as Mr. Andrews walks his daughter down the aisle, he quietly encourages Ellie to run off again, telling her that her car is out back for a quick get-away. At the point where she is to say &quot;I do&quot;, she makes up her mind. She runs off to find Peter. Her pleased father pays Westley off, enabling Ellie to marry Peter.\n\nCast\n\nClark Gable as Peter Warne\nClaudette Colbert as Ellie Andrews\nWalter Connolly as Alexander Andrews\nRoscoe Karns as Oscar Shapeley, an annoying bus passenger who tries to pick up Ellie\nJameson Thomas as &quot;King&quot; Westley\nAlan Hale as Danker\nArthur Hoyt as Zeke\nBlanche Friderici as Zeke's wife\nCharles C. Wilson as Joe Gordon\nWard Bond appears early in the film in an uncredited role as a bus driver\n\nAt the 7th Academy Awards for 1934, It Happened One Night became the first film ever to win the &quot;Big Five&quot; Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Writing). To date, only two more films have achieved this feat: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975 and The Silence of the Lambs in 1991.[17] Also, It Happened One Night was the last film to win both lead acting Academy Awards, until 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest also won both lead acting awards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad373ed9cfaacf570c111b6c0500c152a192fa18","amp;dn":"Best+Picture+-+1934+-+It+Happened+One+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad373ed9cfaacf570c111b6c0500c152a192fa18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,55,62,217,207,170,207,87,12,17,27,108,5,0,193,82,161,146,250,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
