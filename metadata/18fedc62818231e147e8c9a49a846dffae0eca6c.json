It apears aprox 3x in the\nmovie and only lasts for a few secs. I didnt blur this, out of\nrespect for my source. I have also respected that, and have left\nthe logo, don't worry it isn't really bold and doesn't make any\npart of the movie really unviewable. So nothing serious. Now,\nyou are probably wondering why we are releasing a CAM, as a TS is\nalready out. The reason for this is the same as what DD said, the\n&quot;LiNE&quot; audio is pretty horrible and in many instances the CAM\naudio was better and easier to clean up. So now for the last part\nof the READNFO part: This is much better than the older CAM's\ngoing around, which we very very dark. Don't expect wonders as\nthis is still dark in the dark scenes, only difference is that you\nyou can actually see more of what's happening this time around.\nAs always, it's free so why complain? Right that's the whole READ-\nNFO part over. Now work done; we took the sweet source from DD,\nDropped it in for conversion, whilst it was there we added a few\nfilters of our own, before then tweaking our custom encoding setti-\nngs and converting down to a 500mb file. Looks way better than our\nV1. The audio sounds way better, but don't expect studio quality,\nit's still a bit muffled and has some minor issues, but it's free\nand the best out so you can't complain.
