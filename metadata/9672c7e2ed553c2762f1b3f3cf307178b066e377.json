Written by leaders in the fields of biology and statistics, the book emphasizes the interpretation of test results and provides the necessary formulae in an easily accessible manner.\n\nThe book begins by reviewing all pertinent biology, and then provides information on every aspect of DNA analysis, including modern interpretation methods and issues, and contemporary population genetic models available for estimating DNA frequencies or likelihood ratios. Following a chapter on procedures for validating databases, the text presents overviews and performance assessments of both modern sampling uncertainty methods and current paternity testing techniques. Later chapters discuss the latest methods for mixture analysis, LCN (ultra trace) analysis, and non-autosomal (mito, X, and Y) DNA analysis. The text concludes with procedures for disaster victim identification and information on DNA intelligence databases.\n\nSupported by numerous tables and over 800 references, this authoritative book provides a link among the biological, forensic, and interpretative domains of the DNA profiling field. It is a valuable resource that allows forensic scientists and technicians, molecular biologists, and attorneys to use forensic DNA evidence to its greatest potential.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 552 pages\n    * Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (November 29, 2004)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0849330173\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0849330179","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9672c7e2ed553c2762f1b3f3cf307178b066e377","amp;dn":"Forensic+DNA+Evidence+Interpretation%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9672c7e2ed553c2762f1b3f3cf307178b066e377","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,114,199,226,237,85,60,39,98,241,179,243,207,48,113,120,176,102,227,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
