While most of the detainees were doomed, some 1,700 men, women and children were diverted to a former Jewish community center on Rosenstrasse. Segregated because they were either married to non-Jewish Germans or the progeny of such marriages, the prisoners huddled together while outside, their German relatives, women mostly, initiated an unprecedented protest against the Nazi terror machine. In &quot;Rosenstrasse,&quot; the German director Margarethe von Trotta revisits this relatively obscure episode from Germany's Nazi past to dismally inept effect. Known for politically charged movies about tough women, Ms. von Trotta here foregoes the typical historical reconstruction and instead attempts to put the past and the present into conversation. Because she isn't a historian it's arguable that her allegiance to the historical record need not be as firm as her commitment to her art, which at least here appears tenuous at best. That reasoning would certainly fly better if the filmmaker didn't try to wrench an object lesson about female empowerment from the Rosenstrasse protest.\n\n\n\nDirector Margarethe von Trotta\nCertificate 12 years and over\nYear 2003\nScreen Widescreen 1.85:1 Anamorphic\nLanguages German - Dolby Digital (5.1)\nSubtitles Swedish Norwegian\nDuration 2 Hours and 16 minutes (approx)\nRegion Region 2\n\nAustralia Released PAL Region 0 DVD \nTrailer(s) \nScene Access \nPhoto Gallery \n\nActors\n\nKatja Riemann, Maria Schrader, Martin Feifel, JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rgen Vogel, Jutta Lampe, Doris Schade, Fedja van HuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªt, Carola Regnier, Svea Lohde &amp; Plien van Bennekom\n\nRosenstrasse [2003 PAL DVD][De Subs[Sv.No]\n\nBeskrivning pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ Svenska\n\nEn stark historia om en grupp starka kvinnor som kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤mpar fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶r sina mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ns rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤tt under andra vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rldskriget.\n\nSpeltid 130 min\nEAN-kod 7321939941640\nTextning Norska Svenska \nLjud Tyska (Dolby Digital 5.1)\nBild Widescreen 2.35:1 (anamorfisk)\nLokal titel Kvinnorna pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ Rosenstrasse\nOrginal titel Rosenstrasse\nGenre Drama Krigsfilm World Cinema \nProduktionsland Tyskland\nPremiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥r 2003\nRegi Margarethe von Trotta\nManus Pamela Katz Margarethe von Trotta \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:101b430a4c34a64c9b9364545c3bafc67fabdea5","amp;dn":"Rosenstrasse+%5B2003+PAL+DVD%5D%5BDe+Subs%5BSv.No%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"101b430a4c34a64c9b9364545c3bafc67fabdea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,27,67,10,76,52,166,76,155,147,100,84,92,59,175,198,127,171,222,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
