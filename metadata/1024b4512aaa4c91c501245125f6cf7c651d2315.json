Having recently graduated from high school, the bandmates wasted little time amassing a cult following, eventually rising to the upper tier of punk-pop music alongside Saves the Day and other Warped Tour-affiliated bands. \n\nReleased: October 4, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Punk-Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~1,050 kbps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
