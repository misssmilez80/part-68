All FASM releases were done by THE PEOPLE for THE PEOPLE, so if you think they\n   are worthy share them anywhere you want, but if you like the movie, show your\n   gratitude to the creators by going to cinema or buying Bluray/DVD!\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n2. UNFINISHED/SAMPLE movies HAVE synchro problems, full movies DON`T. This is the\n   nature of highly compressed content. The QUALITY of the display depends ALSO\n   from the PLAYER you use. There are some buggy players which display those\n   movies at the significiant worse quality!! If you have any problemms with your\n   video player check &quot;Instruction for fixing your player problemms&quot; folder.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n3. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you have actually seen it. If you LIKED this\n   release - tell others about it. If you didnt, leave a comment saying  why, so\n   I can learn from your opinions and provide you with something better in the\n   future. Everything here has been done with the reason, so if you do not\n   understand something dont assume its done bad. Of course we also make mistakes\n   so any observation is welcome.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n4. I have found that XBox360 can play stereo AAC directly and 5.1 through WINDOWS\n   media center extender. For more info read this forum: \n  \n_________________________________________________________________________________\n5. WDTV devices are causing so much problemms with AAC. I am not sure is this\n   also the case with this release, so its better for me to give you stright link\n   to the disscussion regarding this: http://wdtvhd.com/index.php?showtopic=23287\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n6. Movies can be directly streamed through WWW using Adobe Flash Player 9 or new.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n7. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is h264 compression method optimized\n   directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved,  each\n   revision brings quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard x264\n   encoding is explained by the same reason as XVID encodes are better than DIVX3\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n8. Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source\n   (Bluray) should also work with this release. If you are looking for them visit\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://subscene.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://subscene.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n9. AAC sound must be decompressed and send through HDMI or SPDIF as PCM. Please\n   also note that if you do have video card with HDMI that means you do have two\n   different sound cards. Please make sure you do send the sound to the correct\n   one. Its quite different from AC3/DTS where you send compressed sound directly\n   from the source.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82abf3d04161163f6829a3101052715d5b18aca9","amp;dn":"Thor+%282011%29+1080p+BluRay+QEBS5+AAC51+PS3+MP4-FASM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82abf3d04161163f6829a3101052715d5b18aca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,171,243,208,65,97,22,63,104,41,163,16,16,82,113,93,91,24,172,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
