Life is rough in Reykjavik's post-war slum of Camp Thule, where the abandoned US military barracks have been turned into makeshift homes. Struggling wives and their hard-working husbands try to make ends meet. The younger generation dreams of dollars, Rock'n'Roll and the American way of life. To celebrate or to drown their misery - they're never short of a good reason to booze. Devil's island vividly depicts the everyday life of a wacky family, their neighbours and friends and shows how some of their dreams come true and others don't.\n\n\nDVDRip XviD Avi MP3 - 656 x 400 - 99 min\n\n\nThe movie is in Icelandic language with English subtitles.\n\n\nIf you like it: Buy it!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0164c3894daefc0b922a461911c38c7ce6acd02","amp;dn":"Dj%26Atilde%3B%26para%3Bflaeyjan+%5BDevil%5C%27s+Island%5D+%281996%29+-+Fri%26Atilde%3B%26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0164c3894daefc0b922a461911c38c7ce6acd02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,22,76,56,148,218,239,192,185,34,164,97,145,28,56,199,206,106,205,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
