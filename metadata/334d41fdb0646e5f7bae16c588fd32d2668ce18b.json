This includes most machines with Intel/AMD/etc type processors and almost all computers that run Microsoft Windows, as well as newer Apple Macintosh systems based on Intel processors. Choose this if you are at all unsure.\n\n64-bit PC (AMD64) install/live DVD \nChoose this to take full advantage of computers based on the AMD64 or EM64T architecture (e.g., Athlon64, Opteron, EM64T Xeon, Core 2). If you have a non-64-bit processor made by AMD, or if you need full support for 32-bit code, use the Intel x86 images instead.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:334d41fdb0646e5f7bae16c588fd32d2668ce18b","amp;dn":"Edubuntu+11.10+%28Oneiric+Ocelot%29+i386","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"334d41fdb0646e5f7bae16c588fd32d2668ce18b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,77,65,253,176,100,110,95,123,174,22,197,136,253,50,210,102,140,225,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
