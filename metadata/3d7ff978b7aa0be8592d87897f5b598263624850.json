This series uses the latest CGI and cutting-edge research to reveal the deadly secrets of these new giants.\nFor the first time on British television, the very latest dino discoveries have been brought together and brought to life in this groundbreaking series. Featuring a cast of new dinosaurs that will feed the nation's nightmares, the next generation of children aren't going to be talking about the tyrannosaurus rex; they are about to meet far bigger, badder, more vicious characters that roamed the Earth 95 million years ago.\n\n\n1. Lost World: 95 million years ago, Late Cretaceous - (North Africa)\n\n--Synopsis--\nThe series starts in North Africa, where two of the world's biggest predators once battled for supremacy. At 13m and seven tonnes, the carcharodontosaurus was a huge beast, a gigantic lizard-like carnivore with shark-like teeth over six inches long. It was an efficient hunter that would slash at its prey until it bled to death.\nBut the discovery of an upper jaw in Morocco revealed an even bigger carnivorous killer - spinosaurus. Four metres longer than Tyrannosaurus rex, spinosaurus is thought to have been one of the biggest killers to ever walk the Earth. But unlike the meat-eating carcharodontosaurus, spinosaurus mainly ate fish, living and hunting almost exclusively in the water.\nLike all predators that share an environment, the two may once have had to compete for food. Planet Dinosaur takes a look at what one such deadly battle may have looked like and finds out which giant beast would have been most likely to survive a fight to the death.\n\n--Animals--\nOuranosaurus\nSpinosaurus\nUnidentified Crocodile\nOnchopristis\nRugops\nCarcharodontosaurus\nSarcosuchus\nUnidentified Pterosaur\n\n\n2. Feathered Dragons: 95 million years ago, Late Cretaceous - (North Africa)\n\n--Synopsis--\nThe second episode of the documentary series takes a look at bizarre and extraordinary feathered dinosaurs, many of which have only just been discovered. These feathered beasts are revolutionising our understanding of life on Earth as they blur the boundaries between what we know of dinosaurs and birds.\nChina sits at the heart of the feathered dinosaur discoveries and is the home of one of the most unusual discoveries on Earth: the epidexipteryx. Only the size of a pigeon, this predator was the most bird-like of any dinosaur and is the first known case of ornamental feathers.\nBut feathers were not just confined to the small. From caudipteryx to sinosauropteryx and the 8-metre-long gigantoraptor, feathers may have been used for flight, for insulation or even to intimate and attract. These dinosaurs not only hint at how animals might have developed flight, but also suggest that dinosaurs may still live among us today - as birds.\n\n--Animals--\nOuranosaurus\nSpinosaurus\nUnidentified Crocodile\nOnchopristis\nRugops\nCarcharodontosaurus\nSarcosuchus\nUnidentified Pterosaur\n\n\n3. Last Killers: 75 million years ago, Late Cretaceous - (North America) ; 70 million years ago, Late Cretaceous - (Madagascar)\n\n--Synopsis--\nThe third episode looks at the last generation of killer dinosaurs - carnivores that took killing to a new level.\nBy the end of the cretaceous period - 75 millions years ago - these gigantic and specialised hunter-killers had spread throughout the globe. In the southern continents it was the powerful and muscular abelisaurids that reigned supreme but it was the famous tyrannosaurids (or tyrant dinosaurs) that dominated in the north.\nWhilst the northern daspletosaurus hunted in gangs, using its highly developed smell and hearing to take down opponents like the horned rhino-sized beast, chasmosaurus, in the Southern hemisphere the small-skulled majungasaurus reigned. And though the sharp toothed majungasaurus was an efficient killer of the much smaller feathered rahonavis, that did not stop it from occasionally turning cannibal and hunting its own.\n\n--Animals--\nDaspletosaurus\nChasmosaurus\nTroodon\nEdmontosaurus\nMajungasaurus\nRahonavis\nCentrosaurus\nUnidentified Crocodilian\n\n\n4. Fight for Life: 147 million years ago, Late Jurassic - (Europe) ; 150 million years ago, Late Jurassic - (North America)\n\n--Synopsis--\nThis episode focuses on the Jurassic period, a time when the first giant killers stalked the Earth and lurked in the seas; a time when the slightest advantage meant the difference between life and death.\nIn North America the iconic allosaurus, an ambush hunter with a lethal bite, dominated. Not even the heavily-armoured stegosaurus was safe from this killer, and incredible evidence reveals a glimpse of a vicious battle between these two giants.\nLife in Jurassic oceans was no easier; in 2008, a fossil was dug out of a frozen island high in the Arctic. It was a colossal marine reptile, twice as big as most ocean predators, at 15 metres long and weighing about 45 tonnes. This was Predator X. Its skull alone was nearly twice the size of a tyrannosaurus rex's, and its bite force unmatched by anything in the Jurassic seas.\nThe balance of power between predator and prey is a fine one, as prey continually evolve different ways to avoid predators. But for the most successful and enduring predators, the battle to survive has always been tipped in their favour.\n\n--Animals--\nUnidentified Ammonite\nSquatina\nKimmerosaurus\nUnidentified Fish\nPredator X\nStegosaurus\nCamptosaurus\nUnidentified Pterosaur\nAllosaurus\nSaurophaganax\n\n\n5. New Giants: 100 million years ago, Late Cretaceous - (South America) ; 95 million years ago, Late Cretaceous- (North Africa)\n\n--Synopsis--\nThis episode of the documentary series focuses on the new giants, the heavyweights of the dinosaur world. It is only in recent years that experts have unearthed the biggest dinosaurs that ever lived.\nOne monster eclipsed all others; more than seven times as heavy as diplodocus was the immense argentinosaurus - a single backbone was bigger than a human.\nFor years, these giants were considered immune to attack from any predator - until the discovery of mapusaurus, a new giant killer whose fate appeared to be inextricably linked to argentinosaurus.\n\n--Animals--\nArgentinosaurus\nUnidentified Chaoyangopterid Pterosaur\nSkorpiovenator\nMapusaurus\nOuranosaurus\nParalititan\nUnidentified Crocodile\nSarcosuchus\nUnidentified Hypsilophodont\nCarcharodontosaurus\n\n\n6. The Great Survivors: 65 million years ago, Late Cretaceous - (HaÃƒË†Ã¢â‚¬Âºeg Island, Romania) ; 92 million years ago, Late Cretaceous - (Zuni Basin, USA) ; 85 million years ago, Late Cretaceous - (Mongolia, Asia)\n\n--Synopsis--\nThe final episode explores dinosaurs' extraordinary ability to survive. Featured dinosaurs include the bizarre magyarosaurus, which lived in the shadow of the biggest flying animal - hatzegopteryx - and showed an amazing adaptation to island life; and the weird nothronychus, a carnivore that gave up meat eating.\nThis astonishing capacity to evolve into ever more diverse and bizarre forms meant that dinosaurs not only spread throughout the world, but also dominated life upon it for more than 160 million years. It was only an unprecedented extraterrestrial event that finally saw the end of planet dinosaur.\n\n--Animals--\nBradycneme\nMagyarosaurus\nUnidentified Lizard\nUnidentified Pterosaur\nHatzegopteryx\nUnnamed Zuni Basin Tyrannosaur (identified as Zuni-tyrannus in programme)\nNothronychus\nUnidentified Oviraptorid\nAlectrosaurus\nGigantoraptor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d7ff978b7aa0be8592d87897f5b598263624850","amp;dn":"Planet+Dinosaur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d7ff978b7aa0be8592d87897f5b598263624850","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,127,249,120,183,170,11,232,89,45,135,137,127,91,89,130,99,98,72,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
