Episode 1.\n\nThree-part documentary series in which Dr Alice Roberts reveals how the human body tells the story of our evolution. The way we look, think and behave is a product of a six-million-year struggle for survival that transformed us from forest-dwelling apes to the most powerful species on the planet. In this episode Dr Roberts examines our skeleton with its long legs and narrow waist, which, together with our naked, furless skin and rounded bottom, reveals how our ancestors survived on the open plains.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25e2f8f35d4bb9490b6db1f3dba2369197ee1ad9","amp;dn":"Origins+of+Us+-+Part+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25e2f8f35d4bb9490b6db1f3dba2369197ee1ad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,226,248,243,93,75,185,73,11,109,177,243,219,162,54,145,151,238,26,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
