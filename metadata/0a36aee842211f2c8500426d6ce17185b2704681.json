Epic Win is   \n  the place to find out, as host Alexander Armstrong welcomes ordinary  \n  individuals to put these, and more extraordinary abilities, to the    \n  test. As well as taking on their personal challenge, each contestant  \n  will also face an epic panel consisting of comedians Micky Flanagan   \n  and Jason Byrne, plus actor and presenter Joe Swash. If our heroes    \n  succeed in their challenge, the panel will evaluate the skill, and    \n  the contestant will play against the epic totaliser to win up to      \n  3,000 pounds! Joining Alexander and the panel is comedian Joe         \n  Lycett, who will be lending his totally epic voice as the on-screen   \n  announcer.                                                            \n                                                                        \n  Enjoy this aptly named UK show!                                       \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;93e4a7f5f0e1f6e4d3f4fef2faffbdf0fcfe&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a36aee842211f2c8500426d6ce17185b2704681","amp;dn":"Epic.Win.S01E06.WEBRip.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a36aee842211f2c8500426d6ce17185b2704681","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,54,174,232,66,33,31,44,133,0,66,109,108,225,113,133,178,112,70,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
