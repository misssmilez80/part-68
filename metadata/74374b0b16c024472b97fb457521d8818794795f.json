This was the dawn of western  \n    civilisation, which saw the birth of democracy,           \n    language, science and medicine.                            \n                                                              \n    From here Joanna travels around the southern region of   \n    Greece from Athens to the Peloponnese, visiting           \n    spectacular mythical and historic sites left by this       \n    great civilisation. These were places of theatre, death   \n    sport and religion to the Ancients and they represent    \n    the very cornerstone of this empire. The Greeks flocked   \n    to these sites and Joanna follows in their footsteps.      \n                                                              \n    En route she meets modern Greeks who are still           \n    influenced by this ancient era.                           \n                                                               \n    From the marble cutters on the Acropolis who continue     \n    to use the same tools as their ancestors, to the         \n    Englishman who now worships the god of Apollo at          \n    Greeces most sacred place, Delphi.                        \n                                                              \n    Joannas route takes her off the tourist trail to        \n    places where ancient myths and cultures live on. She      \n    meets villagers who communicate by whistling, a lady       \n    who lives a solitary life in an almost deserted village   \n    surviving by eating wild plants and shrubs and a         \n    fisherman who takes her to the gates of Hades, the        \n    underworld, where the Ancients went when they died.        \n    Joanna finds inspiration in the isolated peninsula of     \n    the Mani, where its haunting tower house settlements     \n    and barren landscape seem unchanged for centuries.        \n                                                               \n    Joanna also takes part in a Bouzoukia, a hugely popular   \n    singing club where, in a modern twist on an old          \n    tradition, the audience spends a fortune on flowers       \n    that they throw in appreciation.                           \n                                                              \n    And finally Joanna meets perhaps one of the most famous  \n    singers in the world, Nana Mouskouri, at Epidaurus, one   \n    of the best surviving amphitheatres, where, in order to    \n    demonstrate the perfect acoustics, Nana gives a rare      \n    performance to Joanna.                                   \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.itv.co","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74374b0b16c024472b97fb457521d8818794795f","amp;dn":"Joanna.Lumleys.Greek.Odyssey.S01E01.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74374b0b16c024472b97fb457521d8818794795f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,55,75,11,22,192,36,71,43,151,251,69,117,33,216,129,135,148,121,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
