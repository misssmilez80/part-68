That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n\n=================================\n\n     Life in the world acknowledged alike by empiricists, most other philosophies, scientists of all stripes, spots, and colors, (or lack thereof), theologians, and the man on the street (women are for the most part less likely to be found lying on the street imhop), as I say my so-called life -  continues to be busy. Especially that annoying wait between going to work and going home. Life in the real world, the world of my imagination, continues to be exciting as I captain starships, rescue fair maidens (unfair maidens have no sense of justice) and small children (with very grateful mothers),  gain immense wealth with no work -  using it  of course to save endangered species, feed the starving, heal the sick, house the homeless and generally be a do-gooder,  rule the Earth as a wise and benevolent King-ushering in a golden age of peace and prosperity, all the while creating a lasting, democratic and free government to succeed me, gain assorted super-powers, and let's not forget -  have a red-haired, green eyed, Irish accented wife, probably named Kathleen. (Yes I am happily married but all attempts to convince my wife to dye her hair, get contact lenses, affect an Irish accent, and change her name to Kathleen - all while insisting I love her &quot;just the way she is&quot; have oddly met with failure.)\n\n     Hard to believe we have now finished the letter R! \n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering:  DC from  DC from Re-Rz\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRe-Evolution 1-2 (Zudacomics-DC Web(2008-2009)\nRe-Gifters (Minx(2007)\nReal Fact Comics 01-21 (1946-1949)\nReal Power In the DC Universe, The.jpg\nReal Screen Comics 02-128-after RS Funnies 01 (1945-1959)\nReal Screen Funnies 001 (1945)\n\nRealworlds\n     Realworlds-Batman (2000)\n     Realworlds-Justice League of America (2000)\n     Realworlds-Superman (2000)\n     Realworlds-Wonder Woman (2000)\n\nR.E.B.E.L.S\n     R.E.B.E.L.S 01-17 (1994-1996)\n          R.E.B.E.L.S '94 0, 01-02\n          R.E.B.E.L.S '95 03-14\n          R.E.B.E.L.S '96 15-17\n     R.E.B.E.L.S cover art\n     R.E.B.E.L.S v2 01-28 (2009-2011)\n     R.E.B.E.L.S v2 Annual 001-Starro the Conqueror (2009)\n\nRecipe for Gertrude, The v1-5 (CMX\nRed 01-03 (Homage(2003)\n\nRed Circle, The (2009)\n     Red Circle, The-Inferno 001 (2009)\n     Red Circle, The-The Hangman 001 29p (2009)\n     Red Circle, The-The Shield 001 (2009)\n     Red Circle, The-The Web 001\n\nRed Faction-Armageddon (2011)\nRed Faction-Guerrilla (2009)\n\nRed Herring 01-06 (WS(2009-2010)\nRed Hood-The Lost Days 01-06 (2010)\nRed Menace 01-06 (WS(2007)\nRed Robin 01-26 (2009-2011)\nRed Sonja-Claw 01-04 (Dynamite-WS(2006)\n\nRed Tornado\n     Red Tornado v1 01-04 (1985)\n     Red Tornado v2 01-06 (2009-2010)\n\nRed-The Movie\n     Red-Eyes Only ctc (2011)\n     The four prequels (WS((2010)\n          Red-Frank ctc (2010)\n          Red-Joe ctc (2010)\n          Red-Marvin ctc (2010)\n          Red-Victoria ctc (2010)\n\nReign in Hell 01-08 (2008-2009)\nReign of the Zodiac 01-08 (2003-2004)\nRelative Heroes 01-06 (2000)\nReload 01-03 (Homage(2003)\nRemarkable Worlds Of Professor Phineas B.
