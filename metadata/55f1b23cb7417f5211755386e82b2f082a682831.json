It's a bit &quot;edgy&quot; so this isn't for the timid or easily offended. \n\nIf you like it, I would really appreciate it if you could find the time to leave a good review on either my kindle or nook listing. Just search for &quot;Z Strain&quot; or &quot;Rutger Klamor&quot;, and I'm sure you'll find it. \n\nNaturally, no obligation. Just enjoy! Finally, a book written by a die-hard zombie fan for die-hard zombie fans!\n\nThanks a lot,\n\nRutger \n\nps: this is a correction to my first upload &quot;Z Strain&quot; because I think I may have messed something up. Please forgive me and give it another go!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55f1b23cb7417f5211755386e82b2f082a682831","amp;dn":"Z+Strain+-+correction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55f1b23cb7417f5211755386e82b2f082a682831","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,241,178,60,183,65,127,82,17,117,83,134,232,43,47,8,42,104,40,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
