Mixamix_20110717 was my summer company. I finished it just one day before leaving for vacations.\nIt's powerfull ,it's meant to heard loud and it's meant to be enjoyed. \nAs usual it's full of surprises and various kinds of music.\nStarting with all time classic tracks line &quot;BBE-Flash&quot; and Westbam. Then some dubstep including one of the greatest hits \nof last year, the &quot;Imogen Heap - Hide And Seek&quot; in two versions I mucho like! \n&quot;Daft Punk - HBFS (InContext Remix)&quot; is a blowing mind remix and then an excellent free track &quot;Wreckage Machinery &amp; TheSquare - BluePlanet&quot;.\nA little turn to greek rock music with &quot;Trypes&quot; and then back to dance. Two tracks down find &quot;Mark Angelo - Turn Back Time (feat Onirama)&quot;, a great greek production.\nI hope you will like my two choices of &quot;Adele - Hometown Glory&quot; intermixed with a personal touch by me and then we have remix that really brought tears to my eyes. \nIt is the &quot;Robert Miles - Children (InContext Remix)&quot;. A complete revival of the all time classic track.\nI hope you will enjoy the inter-mixing of tracks 20,21 concluding with &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra, Op. 30 - - Richard Strauss&quot;! \nThat amazing classical music piece gave me the oporumity to create a dynimic outro of four tracks and as you will hear &quot;Anything is possible&quot;!\nWith tracks like &quot; Sonny J. - Cant stop moving (The Young Punx Remix)&quot; , &quot;Van Halen - JUMP&quot; and the unique &quot;Vampy - Hi There (Original Mix)&quot; I hope you\nwill end with a smile on your face.\n\nI really hope you will enjoy this mix. I really believe it is one of my best! \n\nAs always I hope you will share my excitement for music that can accompany you to highway or countryside explorations.\n\nKeep travelling, sharing music and have fun!\n\nDj Mentzik (2011).\n\n\n26 tracks in playlist, average track length: 3:06\nPlaylist length: 1 hour 21 minutes 1 second \n\nPlaylist files:\n\n1.
