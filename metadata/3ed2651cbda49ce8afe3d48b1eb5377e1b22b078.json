Their contrasting personalities (one is tough and the other sensitive) strengthen them as a team, allowing each a different perspective on both personal and professional situations. Cagney &amp; Lacey is an American television series that first aired on the CBS television network for seven seasons. A police procedural, the show stars Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly as New York City police detectives who led very different lives: Christine Cagney (Gless) was a single, career-minded woman, while Mary Beth Lacey (Daly) was a married working mother.The two main actresses combined to win the Emmy for Best Lead Actress in a Drama six straight years in a row, a winning streak unmatched in any series.\n\nOf NOTE:Loretta Swit plays the role of Christine Cagney in the original television movie (1981), but she was forced to decline the role in the series when the producers of M*A*S*H refused to let her out of her contract. The movie was then picked up as a series, first airing with six episodes as a midseason replacement in the spring of 1982, with Meg Foster playing the role of Cagney. The show was then picked up for a regular season beginning with the 1982ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“83 season, but Foster was replaced by Sharon Gless because CBS deemed Foster too aggressive and too likely to be perceived as a lesbian by the viewers.CBS executives hoped that Sharon Gless would portray Christine Cagney as more conventionally &quot;feminine&quot; and attempted to pressure the producers to remake Christine into a more &quot;high-class&quot;, snobbish woman from wealthy parents. Barney Rosenzweig and Barbara Corday stood their ground, refusing to change Christine Cagney from a tough, witty, working-class woman.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ed2651cbda49ce8afe3d48b1eb5377e1b22b078","amp;dn":"Cagney+and+Lacey+++%28Season+1+-+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ed2651cbda49ce8afe3d48b1eb5377e1b22b078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,210,101,28,189,164,156,232,175,227,212,139,30,181,55,126,27,34,176,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
