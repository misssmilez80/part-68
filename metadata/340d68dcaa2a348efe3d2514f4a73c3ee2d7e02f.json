Capote is played by Toby Jones. The same role in the previous film version earned an Academy Award for actor Philip Seymour Hoffman.\n\nToby Jones as Truman Capote \nSandra Bullock as Harper Lee \nLee Pace as Richard Hickock \nDaniel Craig as Perry Smith \nJeff Daniels as Alvin Dewey \nPeter Bogdanovich as Bennett Cerf \nHope Davis as Slim Keith \nIsabella Rossellini as Marella Agnelli \nJuliet Stevenson as Diana Vreeland \nSigourney Weaver as Babe Paley \nMichael Panes as Gore Vidal \nJohn Benjamin Hickey as Jack Dunphy \nGwyneth Paltrow as Kitty Dean \n\nThe film's original title alternated between Have You Heard? and Every Word Is True.\n\nThe singer portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow originally was intended to be Peggy Lee. The situation of an audience being held spellbound by a performer falling silent in the middle of a song was based on a real-life nightclub performance by Barbara Cook.\n\nInfamous premiered at the August 2006 Venice Film Festival. It differs from the earlier Capote in that it occasionally breaks away from the Kansas setting to allow Capote's Manhattan society friends and professional acquaintances to comment on and express opinions about him to an unseen interlocutor during mock interviews. It also is more explicit about the romantic feelings Capote and Perry Smith shared.\n\nInfamous illustrates how Capote becomes caught in his own trap. In order for his book to achieve the balance that will make it unique, Smith's viewpoint has to be represented. To get that, Capote must give the convict what Lee describes as &quot;what he wants&quot; - a kindred spirit. For this to happen, Capote must bare his soul. He achieves what he desires, but at a price. He comes to care for Smith to the point where they both wonder if they are doomed soul mates. In the end, Capote becomes conflicted - for his book to have the &quot;proper&quot; ending, the man he loves must die by the hangman's noose. \n\nTo interrupt the linear chronology, director Douglas McGrath inserts &quot;talking head&quot; interviews with Capote's contemporaries. It's not clear when these supposed interviews are intended to take place, although it's after Capote's death. The segments provide useful background information while contributing a quasi-documentary feel. It's almost like watching a History Channel biography, where conversations with real people are interspersed with re-creations of scenes from the subject's life. \n\nSince Capote and Infamous were both in production at the same time, it's unfair to label either as the work of a copycat. Superficially, they are so similar, it's almost eerie (and a testament to how fascinating this era of Capote's life is to current filmmakers). It's the differences in approach that makes both movies worth watching on their own terms. Capote is the more intellectual of the two films; Infamous is the more emotional. They exist to complement, not eclipse, one another. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:340d68dcaa2a348efe3d2514f4a73c3ee2d7e02f","amp;dn":"Infamous+%5B2006%5D+Douglas+McGrath","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"340d68dcaa2a348efe3d2514f4a73c3ee2d7e02f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,13,104,220,170,42,52,142,254,61,37,20,244,167,60,62,226,215,224,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
