Each behavioral event is described, measured in seconds and presented as it occurs in its natural sequence, thus providing a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“real-timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ picture of fetal behavior. Links between events become clear, and events are connected to the changing anatomy and physiology of the nervous system and of the fetal body in general. Transient behaviour with its underlying structures and possible functions is carefully distinguished from anticipatory functions heralding post-natal life. Furthermore, phenomena of physiologic significance during prenatal life, but which can acquire pathological connotations for the premature infant having to meet the different requirements of the post-natal environment, are also outlined. Finally, various prenatal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“mythsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ are discussed, in order to give scientific information on issues;that are particularly relevant, given the heated pro-life versus pro-choice debate.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 250 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (August 11, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 8847014018\n    * ISBN-13: 978-8847014015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:581b5d6831bf72d85de25cf01ccea5f26466b619","amp;dn":"Development+of+Normal+Fetal+Movements+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"581b5d6831bf72d85de25cf01ccea5f26466b619","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,27,93,104,49,191,114,216,93,226,92,240,28,206,165,242,100,102,182,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
