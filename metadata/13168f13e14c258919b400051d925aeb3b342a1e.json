An Army Major has been sent to Tucson to make peace with the Indians. He is successful with Cochise, the Apache leader, but Cochise is unable to get the Comanches to agree. The Apaches then turn back a raid by the Comanches. There is a man in Tucson that wants the Indian war against the Americans to continue and when a stray Army rifle is found and it kills Cochise's woman, it appears the Apaches will break the peace treaty.\n\nGoofs\n\nFactual errors: The Apaches are shown wearing feathered warbonnets. This was a headdress worn by Plains Indians - which the Apaches weren't - such as the Sioux and Kiowa. Apaches usually wore simple headbands or no headdress at all, but they never wore feathered warbonnets.\n\nuser review\n\nThe Gadsden Purchase of Southern Arizona is the setting for this underrated western that has fine action, good photography and a nice music score. The plot involves the U.S. Government's attempt to forge a peace treaty between ancient enemies, the Apaches and Mexicans, the latter of whom the American troops are duty-bound to protect from Cochise's raiders. Indian-hating Mexicans and trouble-making Americans stand in the way of peace and inflame hostilities on both sides of the border. The Comanches, at war with both the Americans and the Mexicans, hope to enlist Cochise and his Apaches as allies in their war of extinction against their enemies. Robert Stack is the best-known name among a good cast of players who were veterans of many western films. John Hodiak is Cochise, and his mannered, formal bearing as the Apache chief is better than might be expected.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAPOhAadg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAPOhAadg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13168f13e14c258919b400051d925aeb3b342a1e","amp;dn":"Trooper+Hook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13168f13e14c258919b400051d925aeb3b342a1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,22,143,19,225,76,37,137,25,180,0,5,29,146,90,235,59,52,42,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
