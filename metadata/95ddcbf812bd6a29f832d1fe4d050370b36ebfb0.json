The authors address purely electric, hybrid electric, plug in hybrid electric, hybrid hydraulic, fuel cell, and off road hybrid vehicle systems. They focus on the power and propulsion systems for these vehicles, including issues related to power and energy management. They concentrate on material that is not readily available in other hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) books such as design examples for hybrid vehicles, and cover new developments in the field including electronic CVT, plug in hybrid, and new power converters and controls. \n\nInfo:\n-----\n\nISBN        : 0470747730\n\nPAGES       : 468\n\nFORMAT      : PDF\n\nSIZE        : 4.78 MB\n\nYEAR        : 2011\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally \nposting fake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95ddcbf812bd6a29f832d1fe4d050370b36ebfb0","amp;dn":"Hybrid+Electric+Vehicles+-+Principles+and+Applications+%5BGC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95ddcbf812bd6a29f832d1fe4d050370b36ebfb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,221,203,248,18,189,106,41,248,50,209,254,77,5,3,112,179,110,191,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
