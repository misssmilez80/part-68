A remake of his 2010 Telugu film Vedam, the film features an ensemble cast of Silambarasan, Bharath, Anushka Shetty,Vega Tamotia, Prakash Raj and Saranya.[2][3] The score and soundtrack were composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, while cinematography and editing were handled by Nirav Shah and Anthony Gonsalves, respectively.\nVaanam is an anthology film; the story revolves around five individuals from different walks of life, representing the five natural elementsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½sky, air, water, fire and earth [4][5]ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and illustrates how their fates intertwine on New Year's Eve at a hospital in Chennai. The film, jointly produced by Ganesh Janardhanan and R. Ganesh and distributed by Dayanidhi Azhagiri's Cloud Nine Movies, was released on April 29, 2011,[6] and received critical acclaim.[7][8]\n\n\nPlot\n\nCable Raja (Silambarasan) is a cable operator born and raised in a slum area in Chennai. He bemoans his poverty and wishes to become rich by marrying his girlfriend Priya (Jasmin Bhasin). He cons her into believing he is well off, and adopts a well-bred persona in front of her. Raja is always accompanied by his best friend Seenu (Santhanam) and guided by Bhajan singer Ganesh (VTV Ganesh). When he is asked by Priya to buy high-priced passes to a New Year's Eve gala, he finds himself severely short of money. After a failed attempt at chain snatching and crossing paths with the police, he heads to a hospital with theft on his mind.\nBharath Chakravarthy (Bharath) is an aspiring rockstar from Bangalore, who is irresponsible but well-meaning. His mother disapproves of his dreams and wishes him to become an army officer, which he opposes. When his band misses their flight to a live concert because of him, he takes them to Chennai via road. En route, Bharath and his girlfriend Laasya (Vega Tamotia) are attacked by religious fanatics, but are aided by strangers, which causes him to reflect on life. They finally arrive in Chennai, but their vehicle collides with an auto-rickshaw carrying a pregnant woman. Sacrificing their concert, Bharath and Laasya rush her to the hospital.\nSaroja (Anushka) is a prostitute working at Rani Amma's brothel at the Tamil Nadu-Andhra border. When she discovers that her life is constantly in danger while working there, she escapes to Chennai with her co-worker Karpooram (Nikki), an eunuch, in hopes of starting her own business venture. On arrival, she is hounded by both thugs and policemen, ultimately being led into a trap. In an ensuing fight, Karpooram is mortally wounded. Desperate, Saroja carries her to the hospital.\nRahim (Prakash Raj) and his wife Zara (Sonia Agarwal) had lost their unborn twins in a communal riot in Coimbatore. When Zara becomes pregnant again a few months later, Rahim heads to Chennai to locate his younger brother who had run away following the riots. There, he comes into repeated conflict with anti-Muslim officer Shivaram (Ravi Prakash), who suspects him of being a terrorist. Despite his claims of innocence, Rahim is brutally assaulted by the cop, and admitted in the hospital under close watch.\nLakshmi (Saranya) is the daughter-in-law of a poor weaver in Thoothukudi. When the weaver is unable to pay back a loan to a cruel money lender ('Kadhal' Dhandapani), the latter kidnaps Lakshmi's young son, a bright student, and refuses to release him until his debt is cleared. Lakshmi arrives in Chennai with her father-in-law, hoping to sell her kidney to obtain the money. After initial hassles, she undergoes the operation and receives the money, although it is still insufficient. At that point, Cable Raja enters and steals the cash from her, ignoring her pleas. In a state of despair, Lakshmi and her father-in-law contemplate suicide.\nStruck by his conscience, Raja is unable to continue his plan. He admits the truth to Priya and returns the money, even giving up some of his own money, gaining Lakshmi's forgiveness. Meanwhile, Rahim discovers that terrorist leader Mansoor Khan (Jayaprakash) and his gang are planning to kill all the people at the hospital. Rahim tries to escape, but on seeing Bharath wheeling in a pregnant woman, he is reminded of his wife and offers to help them. The terrorist strike begins and several people are shot dead. Raja, Bharath, Rahim and Saroja lead a small bunch of survivors to an abandoned room.\nBharath fights several terrorists one-on-one, sustaining multiple bullet wounds to his shoulder. Rahim saves Shivaram from a shooter and comes face to face with his brother, who is part of the terrorist gang. When confronted, Rahim's brother shoots himself. Just then, Mansoor Khan reveals himself to be a human bomb, and primes himself to explode. Cable Raja sacrifices himself by throwing himself and Khan out the window, and dies in the explosion.\nIn the aftermath, Bharath has lost his hand but is alive; he is hailed as a national hero. Saroja and Karpooram head toward a new decent life, hoping to find redemption. Lakshmi pays off the money lender and gives her son a proper education. Rahim is asked forgiveness by Shivaram, which he grants, and accepts him as his brother. Cable Raja is mourned by the people in his community, and Priya as well, and Ganesh and Seenu hail him as a martyr.\n[edit]Cast\n\nSilambarasan as Cable Raja\nBharath as Bharath Chakravarthy\nAnushka Shetty as Saroja\nVega Tamotia as Laasya\nPrakash Raj as Rahim\nSaranya Ponvannan as Lakshmi\nSanthanam as Seenu\nSonia Agarwal as Zara Rahim\nJasmin Bhasin as Priya\nGanesh as &quot;Bajna&quot; Ganesh\nRadha Ravi as Police Officer\nJayaprakash as Mansoor Khan\nRavi Raghavendra\nRavi Prakash as Shivaram\nKadhal Thandapani as Narasimman\nBrahmanandam as Bhairavan\nNikki as Karpooram\nKrish in a cameo appearance\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1712057/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1712057/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nCredits : \n\nSource : ISTKING\n\nRipper : Dragonz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreens/Covers:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://browseimage.net/out.php/i1368_shot0001bg.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://browseimage.net/out.php/i1368_shot0001bg.png&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://browseimage.net/out.php/i1369_shot0002ea.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://browseimage.net/out.php/i1369_shot0002ea.png&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://browseimage.net/out.php/i1370_shot0005wl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://browseimage.net/out.php/i1370_shot0005wl.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://browseimage.net/out.php/i1371_shot0006x.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://browseimage.net/out.php/i1371_shot0006x.png&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://browseimage.net/out.php/i1372_shot0007c.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://browseimage.net/out.php/i1372_shot0007c.png&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n****check out my other releases****\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/tdkdemon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/tdkdemon/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n****************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;SUPERFAST RELEASES BROUGHT TO YOU BY&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n          \n\n\n                                  Masti Torrents Releasers [ MTR ]\n\n\n\n\n\n            8888b.  888888 8b    d8  dP&quot;Yb  88b 88     88888 8b    d8 888888 88&quot;&quot;Yb 88888 \n             8I  Yb 88__   88b  d88 dP   Yb 88Yb88     88    88b  d88   88   88__dP    88 \n             8I  dY 88&quot;&quot;   88YbdP88 Yb   dP 88 Y88     88    88YbdP88   88   88&quot;Yb     88 \n            8888Y&quot;  888888 88 YY 88  YbodP  88  Y8     88888 88 YY 88   88   88  Yb 88888 \n\n\n\n\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n****************************************************************************************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f62bb74b7cd2679f55ac0c55b1015d0a1dd79b94","amp;dn":"Vaanam+%28Tamil+2011%29+TSK+DVDRip+Xvid+Mp3+Esubs%40mastitorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f62bb74b7cd2679f55ac0c55b1015d0a1dd79b94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,43,183,75,124,210,103,159,85,172,12,85,177,1,93,10,29,215,155,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
