In the ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor, The Crucible mirrors the anti-Communist hysteria in the 1950s.\n\nThis is a wonderfully done recording with good actors. This recording does not follow the script to the &quot;T&quot;, but that draw back is overshadowed by the actors. They bring the play to life the way it is meant to be. This recording is superb.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76c6a7746351cb71ea988165ded0487c3fa3471d","amp;dn":"The+Crucible+-+Arthur+Miller+++%28Drama%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76c6a7746351cb71ea988165ded0487c3fa3471d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,198,167,116,99,81,203,113,234,152,129,101,222,208,72,124,63,163,71,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
