He lived as Mark Stone for seven years, becoming a popular figure in the community, sleeping with women and falling in love with one activist, even as he gathered intelligence. \n\nKennedy paints a picture of two worlds: the mostly well-intentioned world of the activists and the uncaring police he was working for. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to know which is more shocking: his sexual relationships with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtargetsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or the scale of resources devoted to thwarting peaceful protest. \n\n\nEither way, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an eye-opening film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf368cbde5fdba515ab5cfb2326df9dbdb3a24f1","amp;dn":"Confessions+of+an+Undercover+Cop+-+Mark+Stone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf368cbde5fdba515ab5cfb2326df9dbdb3a24f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,54,140,189,229,253,186,81,90,181,207,178,50,109,249,219,219,58,36,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
