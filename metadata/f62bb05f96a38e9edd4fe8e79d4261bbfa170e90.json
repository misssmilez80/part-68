The first thing that I did was get this file down to smaller workable size.  Then I had to strip off the Russian Soundtrack and add an English Dolbly Digital 5.1 Soundtrack to this Print.  The Print itself was pretty much flawless, so-to-speak.  But, I did tweak it a little bit.  I brightened it, by running it through a Brighness Filter.  I did this because when viewing 3-D prints, we have to add glasses, and that darkens the print, when viewing it.  I figured that by adding some brightness to it, that it would enhance the viewing experience.  Personally, I like it.  Please note: It takes Magenta and Green glasses to view this print (Like the ones found in retail copies of Coraline or Journey to the Center of the Earth).\n\nAlso, I placed Chapter Marks in place.\n\nAfter Downloading this file, simply use your DVD file burning software (i.e. Nero Burning ROM) to burn to a DVD to view this on any player.\n\nENJOY! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f62bb05f96a38e9edd4fe8e79d4261bbfa170e90","amp;dn":"Tangled+3-D+English+Anaglyph","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f62bb05f96a38e9edd4fe8e79d4261bbfa170e90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,43,176,95,150,163,142,158,221,79,232,231,157,66,97,187,250,23,14,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
