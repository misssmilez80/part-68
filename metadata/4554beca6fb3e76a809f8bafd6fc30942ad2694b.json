Would their ambitions survive the descent into the unknown on TitanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surface?\n\nThe Hugyens probe was the most distant vessel to land anywhere in our solar system. Stunning images and data were sent back from Titan, Saturn\\'s largest moon. The scientific instruments aboard the probe helped to paint a picture of an exotic new world, with methane seas, volcanoes and cliffs of ice. \n\nThe first-ever pictures from Titan adorned the front pages of newspapers around the world, but the inside story of this extraordinary mission remains largely untold. Featuring never-before-seen footage and exclusive interviews, this is the incredible story of the small team of scientists who were the first to \\'touch the surface\\' of this mysterious moon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducers: Paul Vanezis &amp; Richard Edwards\n=========================================\n\n\n\nProduced &amp; Directed by: Stephen Slater\n======================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Destination Titan\nYear.................:    2011\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:58:53\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    720x408\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1660 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    External English\nFile Size:...........:    699 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2011\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/news/ni9401393/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/news/ni9401393/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4554beca6fb3e76a809f8bafd6fc30942ad2694b","amp;dn":"Destination+Titan-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4554beca6fb3e76a809f8bafd6fc30942ad2694b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,84,190,202,111,179,231,106,128,159,139,175,214,252,48,148,42,210,105,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
