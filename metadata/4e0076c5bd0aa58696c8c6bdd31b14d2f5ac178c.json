The recession is biting hard and\n                Mary and Ella find the bottom has fallen out of the\n                cleaning business. Meanwhile, the benefit office also\n                threatens to let Rab and Jamesie go. The\n                entrepreneurial spirit isn't quite dead, however,\n                even in Govan. Mary and Ella decide to put their\n                singing talents to good use by forming a new girl\n                band called The Scrubbers. Their first gig at the\n                local pub is a hit, but success goes to their heads.\n                Meanwhile Rab and Jamesie set themselves up as Hunks\n                for Hire, sexy male cleaners for bored housewives.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e0076c5bd0aa58696c8c6bdd31b14d2f5ac178c","amp;dn":"Rab.C.Nesbitt.S10E02.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e0076c5bd0aa58696c8c6bdd31b14d2f5ac178c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,0,118,197,189,10,165,134,150,200,198,189,211,27,20,210,245,172,23,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
