But 90 days stretched into five years, and a short-term science mission searching for evidence of water has turned into one of the greatest adventures of the Space Age.\n\n\nThe rovers have trekked miles across hostile plains, climbed mountains, ventured in and out of deep craters, survived dust storms and mechanical failures, and cheated death so often that no one will venture a guess as to how much longer they might last.\n\n\nFive Years On Mars follows this amazing story of two rovers that have explored vast reaches of Mars and may be among some of the greatest explorers in history.\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by : Lance Lewman\n==========================\n\n\nProduced by: MDTV PRODUCTIONS\n=============================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Five Years On Mars\nYear.................:    2008\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:45:35\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    720x416\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1947 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (External English)\nFile Size:...........:    700 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2010\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512837/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512837/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: External Subtitle ( English ) included.\n=============================================\n\n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      **** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click \n\non DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s) \n\ninstead,thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** This documentary is a direct  follow-up from this torrent here:***          \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6717874/Roving_Mars-%28WTC-SWE%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6717874/Roving_Mars-%28WTC-SWE%29&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n\n\n\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a471362f50aafd518941d8fd461ccf9940857d3","amp;dn":"Five+Years+On+Mars-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a471362f50aafd518941d8fd461ccf9940857d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,71,19,98,245,10,175,213,24,148,29,143,212,97,204,249,148,8,87,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
