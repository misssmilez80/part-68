It is based on Billy Hayes's 1977 book and was adapted into the screenplay by Oliver Stone.\n\n\nDirected by \tAlan Parker\nProduced by \tAlan Marshall\nDavid Puttnam\nWritten by \tOliver Stone\nStory by \tBilly Hayes (book)\nWilliam Hoffer (book)\nStarring \tBrad Davis\nRandy Quaid\nJohn Hurt\nPaul L. Smith\nIrene Miracle\nMusic by \tGiorgio Moroder\n\nPlot\n\nOn October 6, 1970, a U.S. citizen named Billy Hayes is arrested by Turkish police, on high alert due to fear of terrorist attacks, as he is about to fly out of Istanbul with his girlfriend. He is found to have several bricks of hashish taped to his body ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ about two kilograms in total ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and arrested. After a while, a shadowy American (who is never named, but is nicknamed 'Tex' by Billy due to his thick Texan accent) arrives, takes Billy to a police station and translates for Billy for one of the detectives. On questioning Billy tells them that he bought the hash from a taxicab driver, and offers to help the police track him down in exchange for his release. Billy goes with the police to a nearby market and points out the cab driver, but when the police go to arrest the cabbie Billy makes a run for it. He gets cornered in a building and is recaptured by the mysterious American. Billy is sentenced to four years and two months' imprisonment on the charge of drug possession. He is sent to SaÃƒâ€žÃ…Â¸malcÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â±lar prison to serve out his sentence. He meets and befriends other Western prisoners in the remand centre.\n\nIn 1974, Billy's sentence is overturned by the Turkish High Court in Ankara after a prosecution appeal (the prosecutor originally wished to have him found guilty of smuggling and not possession), and he is ordered to serve at least a 30-year term for his crime. His stay becomes a living hell: terrifying and unbearable scenes of physical and mental torture follow one another; bribery, violence and insanity rule the prison.\n\nIn 1975 Billy's girlfriend, Susan, comes to see him and is devastated at what the guards have done to him. However, she leaves him a scrapbook with money hidden inside as &quot;a picture of your good friend Mr. Franklin from the bank,&quot; hoping Billy can use it to help him escape. When he is committed to the prison's insane asylum, Billy again tries to escape, this time by attempting to bribe the head guard to take him to the sanitarium where there are no guards. Instead the guard takes Billy past the sanitarium to another room and attempts to rape him. Billy ends up killing the brutish and sadistic guard, puts on an officer's uniform and manages his escape by walking out of the front door. In the epilogue it is explained that on the night of October 4, 1975 he successfully crossed the border to Greece, and arrived home three weeks later.\n\n\n\n\n\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 692 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.850\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #1\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nTitle                            : ITA ac3 448kbps 5.1\nLanguage                         : Italian\n\nAudio #2\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nTitle                            : ENG ac3 448kbps 5.1\nLanguage                         : English\n\n\nMidnight Express won Academy Awards for Best Music, Original Score (Giorgio Moroder) and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (Stone).
