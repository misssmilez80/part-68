In the not-too-distant past, humans shared this planet with other species of hominid. This series tells how, against all the odds, Homo sapiens survived.\n\n\n\n1)Homo Erectus:\n===============\n\nThis episode is set 75,000 years ago in India, following a catastrophic super-volcanic eruption which forced a showdown between our ancestors and a completely different species of human, Homo erectus, who up until that point had reigned supreme. Homo erectus was a successful, long-lived species that migrated out of Africa. Possibly the first humans to live in hunter-gatherer societies, they also used rafts to travel the oceans.\n\n\n\n2)Neanderthal:\n==============\n\nThis episode is set 35,000 years ago and depicts Homo sapiens's encounter with Homo neanderthalensis. As the ice caps retreated, the Neanderthal stronghold in Europe weakened, providing a window of opportunity to which modern humans owe their existence. As almost exclusively carnivorous, both male and female Neanderthals hunted. Evidence of a huge number of injuries, like those seen in today's rodeo riders, suggest that hunting involved dangerously close contact with large prey animals. \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Geraldine James\n============================\n\n\nDirected by: Tony Mitchell\n==========================\n\n\n\n\nTitle................: Planet Of The Apemen-Battle For Earth\nYear.................: 2011\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 00:56:47 (  ) 00:58:28 Each\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: (AC3) \nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 720x416 \nVIdeo Bitrate........: 1677 kbit/s ( ) 1727 kbits\n\n\nSubs.................: External English\nFile Size:...........: 701 MB\nFPS..................: 25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 2011\nParts................: 2 Episodes\n\n\n \n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1986607/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1986607/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n    Episodes:\n    =========\n\n 1) Homo Erectus\n 2) Neanderthal\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4eedce0c8af315c4919408125c22acc6fd278c10","amp;dn":"Planet+Of+The+Apemen-Battle+For+Earth-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4eedce0c8af315c4919408125c22acc6fd278c10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,237,206,12,138,243,21,196,145,148,8,18,92,34,172,198,253,39,140,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
