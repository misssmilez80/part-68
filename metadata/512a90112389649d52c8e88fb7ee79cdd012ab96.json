The marketing people had the same issues as they did for &quot;Grindhouse&quot; -- and cut a trailer and marketed the film out of fear that people would think this really was a film from 1972. Distributed by ThinkFilms / Intl. Sales by Dream Entertainment. The film is available for rent/purchase through Hollywood Video, Netflix, Amazon and other video stores and online retail stores -- in over 12 countries worldwide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:512a90112389649d52c8e88fb7ee79cdd012ab96","amp;dn":"slaughterhouse+of+the+rising+sun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"512a90112389649d52c8e88fb7ee79cdd012ab96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,42,144,17,35,137,100,157,82,200,232,143,183,238,121,205,208,18,171,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
