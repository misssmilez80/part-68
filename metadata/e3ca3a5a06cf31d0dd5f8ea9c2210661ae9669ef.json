Which Berry was, but his bright, skittering guitar style and penchant for writing songs with lyrics that set aside blues clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s for something closer to beat poetry meant Berry's forward-looking version of the blues became something else altogether, creating the very template for rock &amp; roll. It also brought a younger teenaged audience into the game, and Berry increasingly aimed for it. But before that groundbreaking shift in style and demographic, Berry turned out some interesting straight blues sides for Chess, several of which are collected here, and it's intriguing to wonder what might have happened had Berry stuck with the blues rather than redefining it into rock &amp; roll. Highlights include the powerful &quot;Wee Wee Hours,&quot; a chugging version of Don Raye's &quot;Down the Road a Piece,&quot; a try at Guitar Slim's &quot;Things I Used to Do,&quot; the hybrid &quot;Driftin' Blues,&quot; which features a near doo wop backup chorus, and a revved up and rocking rendition of W.C. Handy's &quot;St. Louis Blues.&quot; Berry's guitar work is revealing on these early numbers, his tone always bright and fresh, as if he was a colt who just couldn't wait to get out there and run. And run he did. ~ Steve Leggett\n\nTracklist\n1. House Of Blue Lights - 2:27\n2. Wee Wee Hours (1955 Single Version) - 3:03\n3. Deep Feeling (Instrumental) - 2:18\n4.
