I'm (since writing\n\tbelow) running the game fine, without the\n\tCD, so I think you'll have just as much\n\tsuccess.\n\tI suggest you just mount the ISO, install\n\tand enjoy...\n\n\t\tzzDJChris.\n\n\tSorry Folks, but this is ONLY the (WHA???)\n\tGame's Installation CD. What I mean is.\n\tYou will still need to obtain the CRACK!!!\n\t(This so-far has been found not to be the\n\tcase. The game does not require a crack!).\n\n\tHowever, this is the whole game, unchanged\n\tfrom it's original state, I just bought it,\n\tand haven't obtained the crack yet.\n\tI Have simply RUSHED it out to you, but I\n\tam getting the crack right now as we speak,\n\tso look uot for it.\n\tIt will be here in a blink of an eye.\n\tHowever, I might like to mention that I\n\thave also NOT YET tried it as is. I don't\n\teven know if it needs a crack yet, or if you\n\tcan't just mount the image using &quot;DEAMON\n\tTOOLS&quot; etc, so really...\n\t\tGOOD LUCK,\n\t\t\tzzDJChris.\n\nP.s. Please Seed!!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81a42bb1164574f51fe2bd4535e5af81977c8ccc","amp;dn":"Second+Sight+-+3rd+Person+Shooter+by+-%3DzzDJChris%3D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81a42bb1164574f51fe2bd4535e5af81977c8ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,164,43,177,22,69,116,245,31,226,189,69,53,229,175,129,151,124,140,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
