But perhaps &quot;free cities&quot; will take hold and give people options to move to a more libertarian society.\n\nThe best example of a &quot;free city&quot; is Hong Kong. In just 50 years, it went from being one of the poorest places in the world to one of the richest: per person income rose from $676/year in 1960 to $45,446/year now. That happened because Hong Kong's British rulers sat just around, and - aside from enforcing laws against murder and theft - left their subjects alone.\n\nNow, Michael Strong and Magatte Wade have started a movement called the &quot;Free Cities Institute.&quot;\n\n&quot;We want to encourage thousands of people around the world to create new governments that have different kinds of rules, each competing for customers,&quot; Strong says.\n\nStong's wife, Magatte, is an entrepreneur in the African country of Senegal. She says that &quot;free cities&quot; are especially important for the developing world, where big government keeps people in poverty. She knows that from running a business in Senegal, where &quot;You cannot fire an employee. ... [Starting my company] was an ordeal.&quot;\n\nTonight she and Strong explain their hope to create a &quot;free city&quot; in Senegal and elsewhere. The free city would have none of those burdensome regulations.\n\nTune in tonight at 10pm for more examples of &quot;free cities&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec49c413aa70100577e7d24035ebff8bebaa3b7","amp;dn":"20110930-Stossel-%5BLibertarians+in+Charge%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec49c413aa70100577e7d24035ebff8bebaa3b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,196,156,65,58,167,1,0,87,126,125,36,3,94,191,248,190,186,163,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
