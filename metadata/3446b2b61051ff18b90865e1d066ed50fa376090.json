Woods has been in more\n        foster  homes than  she cares  to remember.  Edna Reilly,  her\n        dedicated  social  worker,  finally  places  Holis  with Josie\n        Cahill, a retired  art teacher whose  home is filled  with her\n        whimsical  creations.  Beatrice is  Josie's  cousin and  loyal\n        friend.\n\n        Josie is delighted to discover  that Hollis is also an  artist\n        and Hollis responds  to Josie's warmth  and openness. But  she\n        soon  realizes  that  Josie  is  increasingly  forgetful   and\n        confused by  everyday tasks.  Fearing that  she'll be uprooted\n        again, Hollis escapes  with Josie to  the summer cabin  of her\n        previous foster  parents, the  Regans. Teh  Regan parents  had\n        wanted to adopt Hollis, but  when their young son was  injured\n        in an accident, things fell apart for Hollis yet again.\n\n        While  Hollis and  Josie celebrate  a most  unusual Christmas\n        together at  the cabin,  Hollis worried  about their uncertain\n        future and whether she will ever have a real home.\n\n\t\t\n\t\tEXTRAS:\n\t\t\n        The Making of &quot;Pictures of Hollis Woods&quot;\n\n        The movie based on Patricia Reilly Giff's Newberry Honor  Book\n        was filmed with the picturesque landscape of  Victoria Island,\n        British Columbia,  as its  backdrop.
