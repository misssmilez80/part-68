Travelling the famous Route 66 from the mid-West to the Pacific Coast, Melvyn Bragg assesses how relevant Steinbeck's work is today. He visits the site of the 1930s dust bowl in Oklahoma; the California orchards where bloody political battles were fought beween migrant labourers and growers; and the Monterey coastline where Steinbeck developed his ideas on ecology. Melvyn Bragg makes a case for Steinbeck as one of the great voices of American literature.\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC in TS\nAudio: AC3 2ch 192Kbps in TS\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 1280*720\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38151f6c027b5a6b461febef1ad09d1493dda51a","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+John+Steinbeck_+Voice+of+America++x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38151f6c027b5a6b461febef1ad09d1493dda51a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,21,31,108,2,123,90,107,70,31,235,239,26,208,157,20,147,221,165,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
