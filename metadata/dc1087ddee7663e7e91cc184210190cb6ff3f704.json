With only a flickering fluorescent light and a locked steel cabinet, he struggles to come to grips with the dangers that now threaten his life. He faces starvation and madness as no one hears his screams and pleas for release. Cunning, ingenuity and hidden clues are his only chance for survival, his only chance to escape the Iron Doors.\n\n\n\nGenre: Fantasy | Mystery | Thriller\nIMDB rating: 4.4/10 from 450 users\nDirected by: Stephen Manuel\nStarring: Axel Wedekind and Rungano Nyoni\n\nRelease Name: Iron.Doors.2010.DVDRip.XviD-EXT\nSize: 697 MB\nVideo: XVID , 688 x 384 , 25.000 fps\nAudio: English , MP-3 , 128 kbps\nRuntime: 1h 17mn 6s 80ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc1087ddee7663e7e91cc184210190cb6ff3f704","amp;dn":"Iron.Doors.2010.DVDRip.XviD-EXT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc1087ddee7663e7e91cc184210190cb6ff3f704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,16,135,221,238,118,99,231,233,28,193,132,33,1,144,203,111,243,247,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
