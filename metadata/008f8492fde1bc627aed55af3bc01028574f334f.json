Whatever description one might make of Ana, she turns out another strong, albeit laid-back, set. This has to be one of the most eclectic covers record since Jules Shear recorded Sayin' Hello to the Folks. Ana starts with &quot;Sitting in the Midday Sun,&quot; a Ray Davies song from the Kinks' 1973 Preservation: Act 1, &quot;Everybody says I'm lazy, they all say get a job you slob, I'd rather be a hobo walking around with nothing than a rich man scared of losing all he's got.&quot; Ana then bounces to Stephen Stills' &quot;Sitting in Johnny's Garden&quot; that appeared on his 1972 band Manassas. Ana embraces the lyric and transforms the song into a dreamy sonic-scape, &quot;There's love &amp; there's caring; This is life; to beauty sharing.&quot; She picks a bit more modern track &quot;In the Backseat&quot; that was recorded by Arcade Fire on their Funeral set, &quot;All is dark in the night; I've been learning to try my whole life.&quot; &quot;It's My Lazy Day&quot; is a Gene Autry song that was also separately recorded by Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson. Three songs have the word &quot;wasting&quot; in the title, which reflects the laid-back sound. &quot;Wastin' Time&quot; is a track from the self-titled set by Ron Sexsmith, &quot;Where's the crime wastin' time with you?&quot; &quot;Summer Wastin'&quot; is a Belle &amp; Sebastian track. Ana concludes the CD with an obscure Harry Nilsson Track, &quot;Wastin' My Time,&quot; &quot;Wasting your time thinking I'll be there.&quot; &quot;Crazy Lady Blues&quot; is pulled from Sandy Denny's &quot;The North Star Grassman and the Ravens. Its charming melody is delightfully transformed to Texas with laid back guitars &amp; pedal steel. &quot;I Could Spend the Day&quot; is a Rod Argent track the Zombies originally recorded in 1968, &quot;I could spend the day just laying here, sweet beside you, wastin' time away with the gentle feeling of love.&quot; &quot;Much Finer&quot; is borrowed from LeTigre's 2001 CD Feminist Sweepstakes. With such a diversity of tracks, there is a remarkable unity in the sound Ana produces. Egge celebrates time to stop and smell the roses with this strong new set. Enjoy! \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/08/27/ana-egge/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:008f8492fde1bc627aed55af3bc01028574f334f","amp;dn":"Ana+Egge...Lazy+Days%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"008f8492fde1bc627aed55af3bc01028574f334f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,143,132,146,253,225,188,98,122,237,85,175,59,192,16,40,87,79,51,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
