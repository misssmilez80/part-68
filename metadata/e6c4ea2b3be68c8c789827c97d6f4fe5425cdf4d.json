I had to strip off the Tamil Soundtrack and add an English Soundtrack to this Print.  The Print itself was pretty much flawless, so-to-speak.  But, I did tweak it a little bit.  I brightened it, by running it through a Brighness Filter.  I did this because when viewing 3-D prints, we have to add glasses, and that darkens the print, when viewing it.  I figured that by adding some brightness to it, that it would enhance the viewing experience.  Personally, I like it.  Please note: It takes Magenta and Green glasses to view this print (Like the ones found in retail copies of Coraline or Journey to the Center of the Earth).\n\nAlso, I placed Chapter Marks in place.\n\nAfter Downloading this file, simply use your DVD file burning software (i.e. Nero Burning ROM) to burn to a DVD to view this on any player.\n\nThe Sub-Titles are still in place from the original print.  There was nothing that I could do about that.  I understand that is some software out there that is available that could blur these.  But, I had already put SO much time into this already.  All I can say is...... \n\nENJOY!
