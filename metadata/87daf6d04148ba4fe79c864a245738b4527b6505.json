I believe that it is in AC3 640kbps. Nevertheless it sounds good through my Yamaha receiver.\n\nThe 3D upconversion is a half side-by-side, so you lose the 1080P to both eyes, but for a conversion I still thought it had a lot of depth. It lacks the pop-out-of-screen effects that Cars 2 will have, being made for 3D, but I thought the depth was a great improvement to the original.\n\nThe container is mkv, pretty universal, should play on just about any mediaplayer/bluray player.\n\nLike I said, this is a first post for me, so leave feedback and let me know what you think. I haven't tried non-animated film yet for conversion, but my guess is that it won't be as good as animation.\n\nOh and please seed to others ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87daf6d04148ba4fe79c864a245738b4527b6505","amp;dn":"Cars+Bluray+%28Ripped+2D+to+3D+Conversion+Half+SBS+Format%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87daf6d04148ba4fe79c864a245738b4527b6505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,218,246,208,65,72,186,79,231,156,134,74,36,87,56,180,82,123,101,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
