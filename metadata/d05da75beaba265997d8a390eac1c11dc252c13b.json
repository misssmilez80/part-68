Paul Newman's narration takes the form of a dramatic storyline that lends continuity to Kolo's adventures.  \n\nKolo is a young meerkat with a big sense of adventure. Deep in the hostile desert of the Kalahari, he and his family have created a home, but growing up is his greatest challenge of all. With danger lurking in every corner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including ravenous lions, limited food, and poisonous snakes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find out how to adapt to his wild environment and thrive. Narrated by Paul Newman, The Meerkats is a beautifully filmed and inspiring look at how in a land of giants, these little creatures stand tall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by : Paul Newman\n=========================\n\n\nDirected by: James Honeyborne\n=============================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    The Meerkats\nYear.................:    2008\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:19:39\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    256 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    592x336\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1227 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    699 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2008\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892391/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892391/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click \n\non DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s) \n\ninstead,thank you.\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d05da75beaba265997d8a390eac1c11dc252c13b","amp;dn":"The+Meerkats-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d05da75beaba265997d8a390eac1c11dc252c13b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,93,167,91,234,186,38,89,151,216,163,144,234,193,193,29,194,82,193,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
