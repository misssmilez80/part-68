Carter has been found guilty of misconduct, with his own uncle - also in the force - proving to be his nemesis. But what should be a simple job is soon complicated by a brutal murder and a weapon that should not even exist. A trail of revelations leads Fox back to 1985, a year of desperate unrest when letter-bombs and poisonous spores were sent to government offices, and kidnappings and murders were plotted. But while the body count rises the clock starts ticking, and a dramatic turn of events sees Fox in mortal danger.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/ian+rankin/the+impossible+dead/8566865/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/ian+rankin/the+impossible+dead/8566865/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb91222f4fdcacf9cc3d2e5d9fd6c3f065f1c0a0","amp;dn":"The+Impossible+Dead+-+Ian+Rankin%2Cmobi%2Cepub%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb91222f4fdcacf9cc3d2e5d9fd6c3f065f1c0a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,145,34,47,79,220,172,249,204,61,46,93,159,214,195,240,101,241,192,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
