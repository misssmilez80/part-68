Chapter 1: Short exposition of probability theory, using generic examples. Chapter 2: Estimation in theory and practice, using biologically motivated examples. Maximum-likelihood estimation in covered, including Fisher information and power computations. Methods for calculating confidence intervals and robust alternatives to standard estimators are given. Chapter 3: Hypothesis testing with emphasis on concepts, particularly type-I , type-II errors, and interpreting test results. Several examples are provided. T-tests are used throughout, followed important other tests and robust/nonparametric alternatives. Multiple testing is discussed in more depth, and combination of independent tests is explained. Chapter 4: Linear regression, with computations solely based on R. Multiple group comparisons with ANOVA are covered together with linear contrasts, again using R for computations.\n\nSpringer 2011\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fd2b8c4a8fae97548a4eaaf5162c582dc5a2cad","amp;dn":"A+Concise+Guide+to+Statistics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fd2b8c4a8fae97548a4eaaf5162c582dc5a2cad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,210,184,196,168,250,233,117,72,164,234,175,81,98,197,130,220,90,44,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
