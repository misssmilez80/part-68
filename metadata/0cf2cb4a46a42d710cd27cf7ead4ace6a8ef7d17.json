not your hdd!!!)\n04. clean\n05. create partition primary\n06. select partition 1\n07. active\n08. format fs=fat32\n09. assign\n10. exit\n\nNow to copy Windows Seven's DVD content to the Flash Drive\nSimply type in CMD the following command to start copying all the content from the Windows Vista/7 DVD to your newly formatted high speed flash drive.\nxcopy /s/e/f F:\\*.* H:\\\n\nwhere F is your dvdrom or daemontools virtual dvdrom and H is the letter or your usb stick\n(F and H are just for example - your letters might be different so pay attantion!)\n\nNote x64 boot is diffrent than x86 32bit boot so you really need to make all these steps if \nyou use the same usb key where you have x86 win.\n\nboot up install enjoy\n\nMethod2:\nuse ultraiso to put iso image to usbkey - also works with win 2k, xp\n\n\nHow to activate office:\n\nOn C: drive I put a hidden folder called IT - i'll explain below it's purpose\nSo after install win and all the drivers do not update windows yet, go to C:\\IT\nBecause IT folder is hidden you may type in a explorer window in addresbar C:\\IT and hit enter...\nThere you have OTK2010V216.rar and IORRT 3.5.cmd\nOption 1: Unrar and use EZactivator to have activated office with 180 days till next activation\nOption 2: Use IORRT to have unactivated office with 30 days reset counter on every restart forever\nNOTE: You can't use EZactivator if you have IORRT installed\n\nWhile the EZactivator installs autoKMS and other goodies the antivil will pop-up that detects unwanted software so you need to allow these in order to activate otherwise activation will fail. The activator is easy to use and if it fails first time you have other options to try again. Don't worry it will work just check green log on it's main window scroll down to see the result. Should state succesfully activated.\n\nWhat for is that IT hidden folder:\n\nThis is only for advanced users so if you're a regular user don't bother...\nIt's purpose is to install specific drivers during windows installation so when windows complete to install the drivers will be also installed and the system is ready to go.\n\nHow can be done?\nWell if you use dvd.iso it can't, you need to create usb stick.\n\nAfter create your usb pen drive with wf7sp1x64 installation files you have to prepopulate usb\\...\\IT\\Drivers\\corresponding subfolders with DIGITALLY SIGNED drivers of your coresponding hardware.\nFirst you have to download the drivers and unpack them. Don't use .exe drivers just inf, cat etc- the uncompressed form of the driver\nNavigate to usb stick to ...\\sources\\$OEM$\\$1\\IT\\Drivers\\ there you have a directory structure with audio, video, chipset, etc place your drivers into the corresponding folders without changing the names of the folders, keep the directory structure intact! ADD ONLY THE DRIVERS THAT YOU KNOW ARE OK, AND IF WIN 7 KNOWS THE CHIPSET LET IT BE, ADD ONLY WHAT IT MUST BE ADDED!\nIf you have a driver that can't be unpacked you can place it to soft folder and define silent swiches in the install.cmd file for example the nvidia driver:\nthe file from internet is let's say 266.58_desktop_win7_winvista_32bit_international_whql.exe it can be unpacked/extracted to a folder that contains a lot of other folders and files needed for a full option install of driver with DisplayControlPanel, PhysX, etc but the main is setup.exe along with setup.cfg so we need to run setup.exe just with silent swich, the rest will take care setup.cfg file.\nSo in usbkey ..\\sources\\$OEM$\\$1\\IT\\Drivers\\Soft\\ we create a folder nv that contains all files and folders needed for nvidia driver and now  we have to edit install.cmd like that:\n\n\noriginal:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n@echo off\nEcho Installing aditional driver software\nEcho.\nEcho nothing to install\necho.\n\nREGEDIT /S %systemdrive%\\custom\\DTlite\\DTlite.reg\nECHO performing clean-up...\nECHO.\nRD /S /Q %systemdrive%\\custom\ndel /F /Q /S %systemdrive%\\custom.wim\ndel /F /Q /S &quot;%systemdrive%\\deploy.cmd\ndel /F /Q /S &quot;%systemdrive%\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\deploy.cmd\nECHO done.\nEcho.\nECHO Pending reboot\nECHO         Please Wailt...\nShutdown.exe /r /t 10 /c &quot;Rebooting...
