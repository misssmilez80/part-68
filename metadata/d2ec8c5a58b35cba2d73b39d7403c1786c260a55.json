The Go    \n  series is designed just for you. It's a book  and DVD  package aimed  \n    at anyone with  the inclination to play,  from   the  25+ generation    \n  with the disposable income to try new things,   to the  over-40s who  \n    are catching up on  a youth spent working  too  hard.  We  all learn    \n  better through visual  demonstration, so  the  Go  series  uses  the  \n    clarity of print and the dynamism of the   moving  image  to provide    \n  the most natural, effective way to learn.                             \n    Written in an  inspirational style  with  an  instructive  DVD,  the    \n  series aims to help you to stop thinking about a  sport and just get  \n    out there and do   it. The tone  is   easy-going  and  encouraging -    \n  theory is broken down into reader-friendly,   bite-sized chunks  for  \n    maximum clarity and accessibility.                                      \n                                                                        \n    Camera: Roger Munns, Russell Campbell                                   \n  Graphics: Jonni Isaacs                                                \n    Online editor: KB.Lai                                                   \n  Voiceover: Michael Andersen                                           \n    Voiceover recording: Nick Miller                                        \n                                                                            \n  (cs)                                                                  \n                                                                            \n  N/A                                                                   \n                                                                            \n                                                                        \n                                    N/A                                     \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n     Directed by: Roger Munns          Written by: N/A                  \n                                                                            \n group info &amp; greets \n                                                                            \n  We are looking for                                                    \n       100mbit euro affil sites                                            \n     dvd suppliers                                                     \n       talented rippers                                                    \n                                                                        \n                                 greets to                                  \n                                                                        \n                      mCZ  DeBCZ  PiVO  SDTV  iCZi                      \n                  for big contributing to czech scene                   \n                                                                            \n                     VOMiT  iMBT  PROMiSE  QiX                       \n             for releasing quality foreign movies with vobsubs              \n                                                                        \n               and other groups who work hard and seriously.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2ec8c5a58b35cba2d73b39d7403c1786c260a55","amp;dn":"Tim.Baker.Go.Surf.Coaching.2007.DVD.XviD-KiNOBOX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2ec8c5a58b35cba2d73b39d7403c1786c260a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,236,140,90,88,179,92,186,45,115,179,157,116,3,193,120,108,38,10,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
