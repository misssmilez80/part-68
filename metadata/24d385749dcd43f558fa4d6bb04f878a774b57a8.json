The dark underbelly behind the hypocritical facade is revealed. Mom and dad find their virginal teen daughter tripping in her closet and running away to be with her biker boyfriend. The neighbor's wife is a total boozer and their Ivy league-bound son is the local pill pusher. &quot;Who are The People Next Door? They are you, they are me.&quot; (IMDB)\n\nDirector: David Greene  Screenplay: J.P. Miller\nCast: Deborah Winters, Eli Wallach, Julie Harris, Stephen McHattie, Hal Holbrook, Cloris Leachman, Rue McClanahan, Nehemiah Persoff.\nCool music from Boston rock band The Bead Game who also make an appearance as McHattie's band in the movie.\n\nThis is a very rare film. It came from a dvd rip of an old vhs tape so the quality isn't great, but it's the best copy I've found so far. If anyone has  better, PLEASE upload! I'd love to have a higher quality edition myself.
