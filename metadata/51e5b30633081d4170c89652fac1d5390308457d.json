But unfortunately for Frankie, this is not the way the world ended. Instead it ended not with a bang but a whimper. Frankie\\'s last stand saw the end of our heroes. What a waste man!\nBut Frankie say \\&quot;Fuck The Past!\\&quot;. Men say \\&quot;he who forgets the past is doomed to repeat it\\&quot;. Frankie say \\&quot;he who can change the past is blessed to forget it\\&quot;.\nIn another dimension of the vast Frankie-verse, there is a better world. In this world there is no such knowledge of something called a \\&quot;Liverpool\\&quot;. As historians would tell it, after the BANG, Frankie said \\&quot;Go forward! Harder! Faster! Longer! More!\\&quot;. And then in a flash an even bigger bang came... the Wasteland. The Wasteland was relentless on an unsuspecting world. Frankie say \\&quot;Make the masses kiss our assets!\\&quot;.  Frankie lived on to fight many a battle. Doing it right.\nAnd it was good.\n\nNumber -1 in a reaction series by Zing Tang Tomb.\n\nSide One:\n1. The Battleground (including The First Voice and snatch of What\\'s Left)\n2. Warriors (what a waste)\n3. Rage Hard (fisted)\n4. Suffer (thank you ma\\'am)\n\nSide Two:\n5. Kill The Pain\n6. Delirious (serious?)\n7. Maximum Joy\n8. The Waves (and ride)\n\nSide Three:\n9. ...use a kondom\n10. Wildlife (watched)\n11. (Don\\'t Lose What\\'s Left) Of Your Little Mind\n12. For Heaven\\'s Sake\n\nSide Four:\n13. Roadhouse Blues\n14. Lunar Bay\n15. Is Anybody Out There?\n16. ...of the wasteland\n17. the end.\n\n\nThe even finer details:\nTHE WASTELAND01.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND01.flac\\' (ratio = 0.464).\nTHE WASTELAND02.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND02.flac\\' (ratio = 0.713).\nTHE WASTELAND03.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND03.flac\\' (ratio = 0.768).\nTHE WASTELAND04.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND04.flac\\' (ratio = 0.732).\nTHE WASTELAND05.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND05.flac\\' (ratio = 0.675).\nTHE WASTELAND06.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND06.flac\\' (ratio = 0.783).\nTHE WASTELAND07.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND07.flac\\' (ratio = 0.672).\nTHE WASTELAND08.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND08.flac\\' (ratio = 0.505).\nTHE WASTELAND09.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND09.flac\\' (ratio = 0.660).\nTHE WASTELAND10.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND10.flac\\' (ratio = 0.757).\nTHE WASTELAND11.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND11.flac\\' (ratio = 0.638).\nTHE WASTELAND12.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND12.flac\\' (ratio = 0.654).\nTHE WASTELAND13.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND13.flac\\' (ratio = 0.689).\nTHE WASTELAND14.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND14.flac\\' (ratio = 0.699).\nTHE WASTELAND15.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND15.flac\\' (ratio = 0.632).\nTHE WASTELAND16.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND16.flac\\' (ratio = 0.738).\nTHE WASTELAND17.wav:  successfully encoded to \\'THE WASTELAND17.flac\\' (ratio = 0.169).\n\nNo errors occured.\n\n\n954451be55fdac644043ab2b4fdf8698 *THE WASTELAND01.flac\n9aa2c76cb8d365dc2cd55545a7182f91 *THE WASTELAND02.flac\n099f6f6223dc2210ccd39dc0f6f35887 *THE WASTELAND03.flac\n81603b252a162eca1ed2d4fa41616b44 *THE WASTELAND04.flac\nb1ccb2c023073b11645192f52eb93e65 *THE WASTELAND05.flac\n23b3e1a13ef646611d26297009653e58 *THE WASTELAND06.flac\na4fa159b82919a7f1818c4e7ad36b4bd *THE WASTELAND07.flac\nc10ab9696d58015e02b3d35ae69cd92d *THE WASTELAND08.flac\na334058863358e74f3f7684d40df76ef *THE WASTELAND09.flac\naed118fa390381fe32970ba2edabbc89 *THE WASTELAND10.flac\ne7c696ffd37dc85319b4786e4f8dc398 *THE WASTELAND11.flac\n8e81dbc56fd30c0461dca4a5f9dad374 *THE WASTELAND12.flac\nfdbed64a87ebf489cd130fcd482956b5 *THE WASTELAND13.flac\neea7a768fe177b36f53e2babc2003604 *THE WASTELAND14.flac\n28e8837559fcbecbf468e83a34588163 *THE WASTELAND15.flac\n4d346830b896e96821f5bf25f849e6e2 *THE WASTELAND16.flac\nc9a55c68a20c9174c0f41c3f44e3f74b *THE WASTELAND17.flac\n\nChecksum file saved to disk.\n\nNo errors occured.\n\nFor those not following along, this is a re-imagining of Frankie\\'s \\&quot;Liverpool\\&quot; using remixes, album tracks and outtakes to create a full experience of an album in the vein of the classic \\&quot;Welcome To The Pleasuredome\\&quot;.
