Francesco also describes the artistic and architectural treasures of the places he visits and brings to life their flavours, customs and histories. And by introducing us to the societies he encounters along the way he also reminds us of the threats they have so recently had to suffer as countries that still bear the scars of a region ravaged by conflict.\n\nBeautifully illustrated with photographs by John Parker, this sumptuous book is a personal invitation to join Francesco to savour and celebrate the majesty and might of the Mediterranean. It is a fabulous fusion of history, culture and travel that will delight fans of Francesco everywhere. \n\n[b]Episode 1: Arrivederci Venezia 00:29:06[/b]\n\nNew series.
