He's got quite an impressive list of bands that he was associated with - Deep Purple, Chicken Shack, Jon Lord Band, Keef Hartley Band, Mountain, Spencer Davis Group to name a few. Many of you may not have heard of Miller Anderson, but many have come across him many, many times over the years in different bands. He is known as one of the best musicians around for such a long time. He's not flamboyant, he's doesn't play the guitar behind his head, you won't find him wearing crazy clothes on stage, - he is just a fabulous musician. His main love is blues and R&amp;B and that is what his band will give us anytime!!!\n\nThe Lizard finally crawled out from under the rock but it was worth the wait. This is an amazing double cd every track a winner with all my favourites from past albums played live. Great to hear numbers from the Hartley days and from Savoy Brown along with numbers he has made his own, Borderline and Misunderstood. Question is why is the album not promoted more, there is nothing on the web, it deserves a much wider audience. ~A Fan\n\nMiller Anderson (Vocals, acoustic/electric guitars, harmonica)\nKris Gray (Bass Guitar, Backing Vocals)\nFrank Tischer (Keyboards)\nKlaus Schenk (Drums)\n\n\nAlbum: From Lizard Rock!
