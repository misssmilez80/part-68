It is about Freedom. Richard Stallman started the Free Software movement, and is probably the biggest computer hero in modern times. He is probably the single most important reason for the GNU/Linux OS being what it is today.\n\nRichard Stallman explains why computer freedom - and freedom in general - is important, and the difference between \\\\\\&quot;open source\\\\\\&quot; and free software.\n\nThe interview is highly recommended, specially if you are using that non-free closed-source OS with NSA back-doors from the corporation who\\\\\\&quot;s CEO regularly pushes implantable microchips.\n\n    Richard Stallman\\\\\\'s Personal Page: http://www.stallman.org/\n    The GNU project: http://www.gnu.org/\n\n        The Linux kernel: http://kernel.org/\n        Nice GNU/Linux distributions:\n\n            Ubuntu: http://www.ubuntu.com/\n            Fedora: http://fedoraproject.org/\n\n        OpenBSD: http://www.openbsd.org/\n\n\nYear.....: 2005-12-06\nFormat...: MP3\nSize.....: 20 MB\nRuntime..: 00:45:14\n\n\nOriginal page: http://torrentchannel.com/Technology/2005-12-06-Richard_Stallman_Interviewed_by_Alex_Jones\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c1815b6f5400ed69331395092a7b55444df4ba4","amp;dn":"Richard+Stallman+Interview+by+Alex+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c1815b6f5400ed69331395092a7b55444df4ba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,24,21,182,245,64,14,214,147,49,57,80,146,167,181,84,68,223,75,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
