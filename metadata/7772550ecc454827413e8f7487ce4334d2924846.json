However, the Impact Engine will not be featured in the PC version of FIFA 12.\n\nImproved AI\n\nThe AI is now capable of realizing which parts of a player's body may be injured, and players run the risk of getting injured off the ball (i.e. sprint abuse). The AI is also said to be 'more human'.\n\n&quot;AI Vision&quot;\n\nThis new system is poised to make passing more realistic than ever before by factoring a player's line of sight into the passing game (i.e. attempting to pass to a player behind the user controlled one is set to be extremely difficult to pull off.).\n\nEnhanced AI\n\nThe AI will now adapt to the game and make better choices that will help the team.\n\nNew Arenas &amp; Presentation\n\nThree new arenas will be featured in FIFA 12 along with a new camera and match presentation.\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â AND MORE\n\nShort Dribble: Flicking the left stick can cause a new short dribble. Further information is not known at this time.\n\nUI Improvements: A brand new, supposedly ergonomic, menu system will be in place.\n\nTactical defending: This makes it possible to defend in a much more advanced way. It is now much more focused on zone defence than on tackling, and therefore allows a much more realistic defensive behaviour. Instead of holding the press button, you now have to perfectly time your tackles.\n\n---------NOTES------------\n\nActually there is a way to play exhibition match now.\nBut you need to have the demo installed.\n\n1.Copy all the files over from the clone dvd folder &quot;game&quot; except for fifa.exe\n2.replace the files at the demo folder except the fifa.exe.\n3.Use notepad and create a file called &quot;rna.ini&quot; in the demo folder.\nadd the line &quot;SKIP_BOOTFLOW=1&quot; in it.\nCan play exhibition for now.\n\nBut i think that the gameplay is identical to the demo due to the exe?\nCareer mode doesnt work.\n\nScreens:\n\n ~ Seed 4 others,Others would seed 4 u ~\n         Be a Gentleman!!\n\n    ______            ______   _______    \n   (  __  \\ |\\     /|(  __  \\ (  ____ \\   \n   | (  \\  )| )   ( || (  \\  )| (    \\/   \n   | |   ) || |   | || |   ) || (__       \n   | |   | || |   | || |   | ||  __)      \n   | |   ) || |   | || |   ) || (         \n _ | (__/  )| (___) || (__/  )| (____/\\ _ \n(_)(______/ (_______)(______/ (_______/(_)\n\n\nAny comments would b appreciated.\nDo rate the torrent quality by giving a +1/-1.\n\nYou can check my other uploads here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/.Dude./&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/.Dude./&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA simple THANKS goes a long way... :-)\nIt would just take a few seconds to post a thanks and wud would appreciate me to upload even more gr8 torrents.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7772550ecc454827413e8f7487ce4334d2924846","amp;dn":"FIFA.12-P2P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7772550ecc454827413e8f7487ce4334d2924846","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,114,85,14,204,69,72,39,65,62,143,116,135,206,67,52,210,146,72,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
