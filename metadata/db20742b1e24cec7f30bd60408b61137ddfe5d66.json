We are still being pushed the same thing from the establishment and the media as to who they want, who they think can win, and what Republican's only choice can be. Well we don't agree with that and won't listen to them. The primary process is used for us to vet out the candidates that we the people don't want - not the ones the media is telling us we shouldn't want. Also, Darryl Issa has subpoenaed Attorney General Holder for what he knew regarding Fast and Furious. Where is the Congress or Obama on this? This is a huge scandal and we are barely hearing anything about it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db20742b1e24cec7f30bd60408b61137ddfe5d66","amp;dn":"The+Mark+Levin+Show+12-Oct-11+CF+mp3+32K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db20742b1e24cec7f30bd60408b61137ddfe5d66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,32,116,43,30,36,206,199,243,11,214,4,8,182,17,55,221,254,93,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
