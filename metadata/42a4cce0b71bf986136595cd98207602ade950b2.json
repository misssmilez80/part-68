Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42a4cce0b71bf986136595cd98207602ade950b2","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+13+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42a4cce0b71bf986136595cd98207602ade950b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,164,204,224,183,27,249,134,19,101,149,205,152,32,118,2,173,233,80,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
