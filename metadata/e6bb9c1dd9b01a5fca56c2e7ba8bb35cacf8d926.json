Skipping Through The Night (2:54)\n\n\nNGC 4594 was an obscure quintet who issued just one single, \\&quot;Skipping Through The Night\\&quot; on Smash Records in 1968. Alongside their sole 45, this CD for the very first time offers a dozen recordings from a \\'lost album\\' the band made during 1967/68. NGC 4594 formed in Storrs, Connecticut, but swiftly relocated to NYC before eventually disbanding in late 1968. For fans of West Coast-influenced Psychedelic music. Sleeve-notes by Tune In\\'s Gray Newell tells the story of NGC 4594 for the very first time!\n\nFormed in Storrs, Connecticut in 1967, they chose a truly astronomical moniker in their search for stardom (NGC-4594 being otherwise known as the \\'Sombrero\\' galaxy). Their 45 features very pleasant psychy soft-rock with the odd jazzy feel. Going Home is the more commercial, slightly more upbeat. Skipping is the gem here with its mellowed-out aura and trilling flute - somewhere between Boston\\'s Freeborne and UK\\'s Caravan. Delightful. \n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6bb9c1dd9b01a5fca56c2e7ba8bb35cacf8d926","amp;dn":"NGC+4594...Skipping+Through+the+Night%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6bb9c1dd9b01a5fca56c2e7ba8bb35cacf8d926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,187,156,29,217,176,26,95,202,86,194,231,186,139,179,92,172,248,217,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
