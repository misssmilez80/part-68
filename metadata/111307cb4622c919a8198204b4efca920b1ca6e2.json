Only on very few occasions has it been possible to enter that world, so closed and rejected. This film is a fresh proposal, revealing the life and thinking of a former officer of the feared Waffen-SS who, even today, appears to inhabit the realm of Himmler and Hitler, aground in a past going back 60 years. \nPaul MarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a Hafner, the protagonist, found in Spain, where he lives very comfortably, under Franco (and indeed in democracy), reliable protection from the scrutiny of international justice. Although he did complete a sentence following the war and has no reckonings pending in any Court, he is in close contact with people who are indeed wanted or have been convicted in other countries because of their anti-Semitic actions and declarations, or because they have denied the existence of the Holocaust. He was also a friend of the war criminal LeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n Degrelle. \n\nAs the film progresses, Hafner draws us into his dark and grotesque world, not devoid of humour and irony until, at its crucial point, he comes face-to-face with the well known ex-member of the International Brigades Hans Landauer, a survivor from the Dachau concentration camp. Both were there on 20 April 1945, HitlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s birthday ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Hafner as SS officer and Landauer as prisoner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:111307cb4622c919a8198204b4efca920b1ca6e2","amp;dn":"Hafners+Paradies.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"111307cb4622c919a8198204b4efca920b1ca6e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,19,7,203,70,34,201,25,168,25,130,4,180,239,202,146,11,28,166,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
