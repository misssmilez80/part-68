Has that great mind finally cracked - Watson wonders - and how is all this connected to Britain's latest secret weapon and the doings of the enigmatic Graf von Bork and the mysterious Society for Anglo-German Solidarity ?'\n\nThis is the third in Barry Day's Sherlock Holmes 'Murder' series and,much as I enjoyed the others,this is his best to date. The basic premise is an ingenious one and the author cleverly interweaves his tale with the actual history of the period.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6362c9a4dd8d13a60ed22f0beab86344df31b4e","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes+and+the+Copycat+Murders+-+Barry+Day","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6362c9a4dd8d13a60ed22f0beab86344df31b4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,54,44,154,77,216,209,58,96,237,34,240,190,171,134,52,77,243,27,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
