Oldtimer). I have included the original Adlib RAW and the MP3 formats. To be able to listen to the original songs through your Winamp you need to install the AdPlug, which can be downloaded at http://www.shikadi.net/adplug/. The MP3 version of the songs are recorded using pseudo-stereo effect of the AdPlug, which makes them sound new. Check it out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf501700019ee7d553e1c3b445450d46babdff35","amp;dn":"Motor+City+%28a.k.a.+Oldtimer%29+%281994%29+soundtrack+songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf501700019ee7d553e1c3b445450d46babdff35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,80,23,0,1,158,231,213,83,225,195,180,69,69,13,70,186,189,255,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
