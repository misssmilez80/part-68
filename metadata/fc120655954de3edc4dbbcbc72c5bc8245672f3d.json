On the streets of Japan, a single music store remains open, its proprietor insisting to his customers that the world is not coming to an end. He plays a forgotten song recorded by an obscure band 37 years ago, and insists that somehow, this song will save the world. A series of short stories spans the years from the recording of the song in 1975 to the modern day, and shows how--in roundabout fashion--the man in the music store is absolutely right.\n\n\nSubtitles srt: English / Portuguese / Spanish / German / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc120655954de3edc4dbbcbc72c5bc8245672f3d","amp;dn":"Fish+Story+2009+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc120655954de3edc4dbbcbc72c5bc8245672f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,18,6,85,149,77,227,237,196,219,188,188,114,197,188,130,69,103,47,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
