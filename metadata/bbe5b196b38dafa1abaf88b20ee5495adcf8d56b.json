The game can be played in singleplayer mode against the computer game AI or in multiplayer mode against players on the Internet or in a Local Area Network. It is also a popular platform for mod developers, with a large number of released modifications that alter the gameplay and theme.\n\nIn-game, players assume the role of one of five classes of infantry: Scout, Assault, Anti-Tank, Medic, and Engineer. Players also have the ability to fly various World War II fighter aircraft and bombers, navigate capital ships, submarines and aircraft carriers, man coastal artillery defenses, drive tanks, APCs and jeeps, and take control of anti-aircraft guns and mounted machine guns.\n\nEach battle takes place on one of several maps located in a variety of places and famous battlefields in all of the major theaters of World War II: the Pacific, European, North African, Eastern , and Italian Fronts. Combat is always fought between the Axis Powers and the Allies. The location determines which nation-specific armies are used (for example, on the Wake Island map, it is Japan versus the United States, while on the Battle of Britain map, it is Germany versus the United Kingdom). The maps in Battlefield 1942 are based on real battles and are somewhat realistically portrayed.\n\nBattlefield: 1942: The Road to Rome is an expansion pack for the Battlefield 1942 videogame. It was released February 4, 2003[1] by Electronic Arts and developed by DICE. Six maps featuring battles that took place in Italy were added (Such as Operation Husky and the Battle of Anzio), along with eight vehicles, including the German Bf 110 and the British Mosquito fighter-bombers and the M3 Grant medium tank. French and Italian forces are included, which has little impact on gameplay. Engineers can now mount a bayonet on their rifle for hand-to-hand combat. The Italian Breda 30 and the British Sten SMG have been added. There is no new opening video. Instead, it only plays the original Battlefield 1942 intro.\n\nBattlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII is the second of two expansions to the World War II first-person shooter computer game Battlefield 1942.[3] It is developed by Digital Illusions CE and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows September 4, 2003 in North America and September 5, 2003 in Europe.[1] It was published by Aspyr Media for Mac OS X on October 25, 2004.\n\nSecret Weapons of WWII brings many new features to the original game, such as new weapons, vehicles, battles, factions, and a new gameplay mode that focuses on fulfilling objectives more than destroying the enemy army.[3] These new features help to bring variety to its predecessor\\'s gameplay without overhauling the series.[4] For example, while an Allied engineer may still maintain his original role as being able to repair vehicles, his long-ranged rifle has been replaced with a shotgun, which is effective at short distances.[5]\n\nSystem requirements\nWindows\n\n   PC:\n500 MHz CPU, 128 MB RAM, 32 MB GPU, 1.2 GB free hard drive space, Windows 98 or newer OS, Original version of Battlefield 1942 installed, Online/Multiplayer: 56 kbit/s modem or LAN.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbe5b196b38dafa1abaf88b20ee5495adcf8d56b","amp;dn":"Battlefield+19us+WWII+plus+Road+to+Rome+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbe5b196b38dafa1abaf88b20ee5495adcf8d56b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,229,177,150,179,141,175,161,171,175,136,178,14,229,73,90,220,248,213,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
