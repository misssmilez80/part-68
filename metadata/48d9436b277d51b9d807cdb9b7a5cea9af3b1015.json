Conflict has aroused  when  Xarax,  ruler  of\nGods of Bellarion, was murdered.  Each  of  the  remaining\nGods claimed the right for the Divine Throne.  After  many\nquarrels, they all agreed that  they  should  arrange  the\nUltimate Challenge in which all the Gods would cross their\npowers to show who is the most powerful to rule them  all.\nBut the Gods who failed were still not willing  to  submit\nto the winner. They summoned their armies and attacked the\nworshipers  of  other  Gods.  By  the  deaths   of   their\nworshipers, Gods lost part of their  power  and  weakened.\nThis deed could not have been left without reply.\n\nAfter 2000 years of battles, Bellarion lies in ruins. Vast\nblack deserts of ashes,  chasms  sinking  into  the  lava,\nearth torn and frozen into the lifeless glacier  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“  thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nwhat  most of Bellarion remained. Gods with  their  armies\nfortified in the heavily protected fortresses  and  sealed\ntheir territories with deadly magic traps. All those years\nthe battle was drawn. Nobody could win. Untill...\n\nThe God of Darkness, Mortagorn, found a  new  weapon.  New\nClerics from his castles  appeared  in  the  battlefields.\nEach of them armed with a pale crystal at the end of their\nstaves. When a cold light shone at the direction of  their\nenemies, soldiers just fell dead to  the  ground.  Neither\nmagical nor physical protection was effective.\n\nAs the last hope, Arswaargh,  the  God  of  Fire,  created\nVivien from his own astral body and sent her  through  the\nspace and time to seek other worlds where there  might  be\nthe counter-weapon he needed.\n\nThe game starts when Vivien opens her eyes in the world of\nAntasion, completely unknown for her. Unfortunately,  when\nVivien traveled through  the  magical  portal  to  another\nworld, she disrupted the divine balance of the  new  world\nand her own divine essence was scattered into  sparks  and\nabsorbed equally by the  gods  of  Antasion.  Without  her\ndivine essence, Vivien becomes a  mortal  being  as  other\ninhabitants of Antasion. She must seek the  Gods  of  this\nnew world, gain back her power and seek the counter-weapon\nagainst MortagornÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death crystals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48d9436b277d51b9d807cdb9b7a5cea9af3b1015","amp;dn":"Gods.Lands.Of.Infinity.Special.Edition-ViTALiTY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48d9436b277d51b9d807cdb9b7a5cea9af3b1015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,217,67,107,39,125,81,185,216,7,205,185,183,165,206,169,175,59,16,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
