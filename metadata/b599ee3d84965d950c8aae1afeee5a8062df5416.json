It was removed by the hosted website but I decided to put it up here to share! :D\n\nInstructions:\n\n-BACK UP YOUR ORIGINAL FILES.  Just in case something goes wrong, make sure you are able to go back to the original state.\n-Open the .RAR file using 7Zip or WinRAR\n-Copy over the files into your Dead Island directory and replace the previous files.\n-Enjoy!\n\nWARNING\nUpdating your game will likely delete your save file!  If you do not wish for this to happen, either do not update your game or find a way to not have this happen.  I apologize but I am unsure as to how to keep the save file. :(\n\n\nSupport the creators!  If you like the game, buy it!\n\n\n*I DID NOT MAKE THIS PATCH.
