No artist \nnames, no release information, no cover art, just pure high class DJ \nmusic. Modeselektor, Siriusmo, Housemeister, Moderat, Headhunter, \nT++ and Shackleton, Bok Bok, Roska and many more appeared on the \nearliest white labels, later bundled as &quot;50 Weapons of Choice #02-09&quot;\na CD that was released as an ultra limited and numbered compilation, \nonly available in indie stores.\n\n&quot;50 Weapons of Choice # 10-19&quot; comes as the even stronger follow up, \nunmixed, with many new label signings, big names and hot newcomers \nall combined on an almost 1 hour long bass mission to defeat boredom.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n*** REPACK *** \n\nThe previous release did not comply to rule 7.3, which states that \nthe proof picture must include a small paper over the medium and/or \ncover with the group name. Instead our paper with the tag was in \nbetween the two.\n\nAnd then we have rule 7.7, which says proof fixes are not allowed. \nUnfortunately there is no other option than to re-release this. \nNothing has been changed to the audio files, only the proof and \ndirectory name is different. \n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b42eb9107be5bb815b7092112eefebb7e3733fe","amp;dn":"VA-50_Weapons_Of_Choice_10-19-%2850WEAPONSCD02%29-REPACK-CD-FLAC-201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b42eb9107be5bb815b7092112eefebb7e3733fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,66,235,145,7,190,91,184,21,183,9,33,18,238,254,187,126,55,51,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
