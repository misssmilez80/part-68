Unfortunately like most bands success met with drug use which led to the band breaaking up which led to everyone forgetting about them.  Best band from the Crow soundtrack you've never heard of.\n\nFirst album was OK, best album was Concentration - very good complete album.  Last album, Gilt, you can tell the drug use.  Great band that should be mentioned alongside Nine Inch Nails, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Depeche Mode, or any industrial/grunge band.\n\n\nAll rips are my own enjoy\n\n[img]http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ENF65C40L._SL500_AA300_.jpg[/img]\n(1991) Machines of Loving Grace\n\n[img]http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gT7V1qzYL._SL500_AA300_.jpg[/img]\n(1993) Concentration\n\n[img]http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SA2JE23BL._SL500_AA300_.jpg[/img]\n(1995) Gilt\n\nI'm the richest junkie still alive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:132a2fed8a020c2d5469d37c9d6a469fa32b7eef","amp;dn":"Machines+of+Loving+Grace+Discography+%5BFLAC%5D%5BEAC%5D%5BLog%5D%5BCUE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"132a2fed8a020c2d5469d37c9d6a469fa32b7eef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,42,47,237,138,2,12,45,84,105,211,124,157,106,70,159,163,43,126,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
