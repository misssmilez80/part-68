Young began performing as a solo artist in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield along with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay, and later joined Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash as a fourth member in 1969. He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 34 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as &quot;one of rock and rollÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest songwriters and performers&quot;. He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a1a582c8e65875584016f72885cce17f4cf6938","amp;dn":"The+Neil+Young+Collection+++%2864+CDs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a1a582c8e65875584016f72885cce17f4cf6938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,26,88,44,142,101,135,85,132,1,111,114,136,92,206,23,244,207,105,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
