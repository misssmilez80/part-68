This is cfw for the PSP so you can play iso images (Games) that you have downloaded, on your PSP. Any troubles just ask me and i should be able to help you. For this to work you have to have OFW 6.39 installed on your PSP beforehand. I do not hold any responsibility for anything that you do with this firware and do not hold any responsibility for anything that happens or goes wrong. I do not own this firmware either.\n\nSteps:\n1. Extract .Rar file\n\n2. Copy the FastRecovery and PROUPDATE folders into Removable Disk G:/PSP/GAMES (So plug in your PSP and follow that directory)(Forget about the other folders besides FastRecovery and PROUPDATE)\n\n3.Unplug your PSP and go into the Game tab and select memory stick and go to the last one with the blue background, so pro update\n\n4. Let it do its thing and just leave it for around 3 minutes\n\n5. The PSP will now have cfw on it\n\n6. To ensure you have cfw properly installed go into the system information and check that it says you have PRO KNIGHTLY installed.\n\nSTEPS TO PLAY GAMES:\n\n1. Plug in your PSP to your computer and on the very first page that comes up when you load the PSP create a new folder called \\\\\\&quot;ISO\\\\\\&quot; without the quotation marks.\n\n2. Copy and paste all of your games directly into the ISO folder and you should be able to play them from the memory stick in the Game tab on your PSP.\n\n\n\n\nI have tried this with my PSP 3000 running OFW 6.39 and it works just fine.\n\n\nSEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!SEED!!!
