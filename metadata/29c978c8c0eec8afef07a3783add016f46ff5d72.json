Now, in the landmark series, David Attenborough's First Life, he completes his journey by going back in time to the roots of the tree of life, in search of the very first animals.\n\n\nAttenborough's journey begins in a forest near his childhood home in Leicester, where a fossil discovery transformed our understanding of the evolution of complex life. Travelling to the fog bound coastline of Newfoundland and the Australian outback, Attenborough unearths the earliest forms of animal life to exist on Earth.\n\n\nThese bizarre and wonderful creatures are brought to life with the help of cutting edge scientific technology and photorealistic visual effects. From the first animal forms that moved to the first mouths that ate, these were creatures that evolved the traits and tools that allow all animals, including ourselves, to survive to this day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten &amp; Presented by: David Attenborough \n==========================================\n\nDirected by: Martin Williams\n============================\n\n\nProduced by: Anthony Geffen\n===========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................: First Life [Episode I Of II] Arrival\nYear.................: 2010\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 00:58:47\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 704x400\nVIdeo Bitrate........: 1774 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................: External English\nFile Size:...........: 746 MB\nFPS..................: 25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 5 November 2010\nParts................: 2 Episodes\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisodes:\n=========\n\n1) Arrival\n2) Conquest\n \n\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1766363/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1766363/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n \nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click \n\non DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s) \n\ninstead,thank you.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29c978c8c0eec8afef07a3783add016f46ff5d72","amp;dn":"First+Life%5BEpisode+I+Of+II%5D-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29c978c8c0eec8afef07a3783add016f46ff5d72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,201,120,200,192,238,200,175,239,7,163,120,58,221,1,111,70,255,93,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
