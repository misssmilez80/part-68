It uses normal explosives to disperse radioactive materials in the local environment, creating a hazard to health that could last for years unless cleaned up.\n\nThe relative ease of making such a bomb means it is a potent terrorist weapon but Horizon's investigation shows that the risk to health from most such devices need not be great. It also underlines the need for governments to act to secure radioactive sources from falling into criminal hands. Horizon deliberately avoids outlining the production process in any detail.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4325baa51e47a188e3b83902a454e7a4d090d97","amp;dn":"Dirty+Bomb++%28BBC+Horizon+2003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4325baa51e47a188e3b83902a454e7a4d090d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,50,91,170,81,228,122,24,142,59,131,144,42,69,78,122,77,9,13,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
