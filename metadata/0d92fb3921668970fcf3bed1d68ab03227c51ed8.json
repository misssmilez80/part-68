His arrival in the groups lineup at the start of 1971, replacing original guitarist Anthony Phillips, provided the group with the last ingredient that it needed for success. In the years since, while Phil Collins may have enjoyed pop/rock stardom and an acting career and his other bandmates their periodic successes, Hackett has come the farthest as a star performer and composer in his own right. \n\nReleased: 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Progressive\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~900 KBps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
