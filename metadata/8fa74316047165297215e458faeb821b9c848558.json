Very British (you no hardly any budget, no faces you know or have even seen before), the accents were a bit thick for my liking, but after a worrying start (a bit too close to home in my case) it began to grow on me. Apart from the some unnecessary jokey cutting that really didn't add anything, I found the film throughly uplifting, very real, natural performances throughout left me wanting more from an ending that came suddenly too soon. Highly recommended!\n\n\n12 out of 13 people found the following review useful:\nA very good Brit rom-com, one to watch., 19 April 2003\n\nAuthor: Susan Nyberg from Edinburgh, Scotland\nA vg Brit rom-com, one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy. Quirky and often surprising, this is not the best of Brady's films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), though it does have a unique charm. Well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high. You know from the start how it's going to end, but when it comes it is honest and very open ended, a realistic and credible ending, the end seemed like a beginning, enjoyable and left me wanting more.\n\nI have also posted several other films by the same director including the cult classic horror/thriller Boy Meets Girl (1994) DVD ISO that was banned for seven years before being released un-cut in this DVD version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fa74316047165297215e458faeb821b9c848558","amp;dn":"LOVE+LIFE+%28UK+Rom-com+feature%29+PAL+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fa74316047165297215e458faeb821b9c848558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,167,67,22,4,113,101,41,114,21,228,88,250,235,130,27,156,132,133,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
