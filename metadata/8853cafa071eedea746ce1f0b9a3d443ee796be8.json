The screenplay by William A. Drake and BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la BalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡zs is based on the 1930 play of the same title by Drake, who had adapted it from the 1929 novel Menschen im Hotel by Vicki Baum. The film is the only one to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture without it or its participants being nominated in any other category.\n\nIn 2007, Grand Hotel was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; The line &quot;I want to be alone,&quot; famously delivered by Greta Garbo, placed #30 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes.\n\nThe film was remade as Week-End at the Waldorf in 1945. It also served as the basis for the 1989 stage musical of the same title. The phrase &quot;Grand Hotel theme&quot; came to be used for any dramatic movie following the activities of various people in a large busy place, with some of the characters' lives overlapping in odd ways and some of them remaining unaware of one another's existence. Such &quot;grand hotel&quot; films have been set at airports, aboard ocean liners, in large department stores, etc., as well as in hotels. Neil Simon alone used the format in both play and film versions of Plaza Suite, California Suite, and London Suite.\n\n\nPlot\n\nDoctor Otternschlag (Lewis Stone), a disfigured veteran of World War I and a permanent resident of the Grand Hotel in Berlin, wryly observes, &quot;People come and go. Nothing ever happens,&quot; after which a great deal transpires. Baron Felix von Geigern (John Barrymore), who squandered his fortune and supports himself as a card player and occasional jewel thief, befriends Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore), a meek accountant who, having discovered he is dying, has decided to spend his remaining days in the lap of luxury. Kringelein's former employer, industrialist General Director Preysing (Wallace Beery), is at the hotel to close an important deal, and he hires stenographer Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) to assist him. She aspires to be an actress and shows Preysing some magazine photos for which she posed, implying she is willing to offer him more than typing if he is willing to help advance her career.\n\nAnother guest is Russian ballerina Grusinskaya (Greta Garbo), whose career is on the wane. She is high strung and seemingly on the verge of a breakdown and utters the famous line &quot;I want to be alone.&quot; When the Baron is in her room to steal her jewelry and she returns from the theatre, he hides in her room and overhears her as she talks to herself in despair about wanting to end it all, holding a vial of medication in her hand. He comes out of hiding and engages her in conversation, and Grusinskaya finds herself attracted to him.\n\nThe following morning, a repentant Baron returns Grusinskaya's jewels, but she is able to forgive his crime. Instead, she invites him to accompany her to Vienna, an offer he accepts.\n\nThe Baron joins Kringelein and Flaemmchen at the hotel bar, and she cajoles the ailing man into dancing with her. Preysing interrupts them and imperiously demands she join him. Irritated by his former employer's coarse behavior, Kringelein - who is aware of Preysing's many swindles - tells him what he thinks of him. Surprised by his uncharacteristic audacity, Preysing attacks Kringelein and the two men must be separated. The Baron is desperate for money to pay his way out of the criminal group he had been working with. He and Kringelein decide to get a card game going, and Kringelein wins everything, and then becomes intoxicated. When he drops his wallet, the Baron locates and quietly stashes it in his jacket pocket, intending to keep the winnings for himself. However, after Kringelein begins to frantically search for his lost belongings, the Baron - who desperately needs the money but has become very fond of Kringelein - pretends to have suddenly discovered the wallet and returns it to him.\n\nAs part of a current desperate merger plan, Preysing must travel to London, and he asks Flaemmchen to accompany him. Later, when the two are in her room, which opens on to his, Preysing sees the shadow of the Baron rifling through his belongings. He confronts the Baron; the two struggle, and Preysing bludgeons the Baron with the telephone, killing him. Flaemmchen comes in and sees what happened and tells Kringelein, who confronts Preysing. He insists he acted in self-defense, but Kringelein summons the police and Preysing is arrested.\n\nGrusinskaya departs for the train station, fully expecting to find the Baron waiting for her there. Meanwhile, Kringelein offers to take care of Flaemmchen, who suggests they go to Paris and seek a cure for his illness. As they leave the hotel, Doctor Otternschlag once again observes, &quot;Grand Hotel. People come and go. Nothing ever happens.&quot;\n\nCast\n\nIn credits order:\nGreta Garbo as Grusinskaya - The Dancer\nJohn Barrymore as The Baron Felix von Gaigern\nJoan Crawford as Flaemmchen - The Stenographer\nWallace Beery as General Director Preysing\nLionel Barrymore as Otto Kringelein\nLewis Stone as Dr Otternschlag\nJean Hersholt as Senf - The Porter\nRobert McWade as Meierheim\nPurnell Pratt as Zinnowitz\nFerdinand Gottschalk as Pimenov\nRafaela Ottiano as Suzette\nMorgan Wallace as Chauffeur\nTully Marshall as Gerstenkorn\nFrank Conroy (actor) as Rohna\nMurray Kinnell as Schweimann\nEdwin Maxwell as Dr Waitz\n\n&quot;I want to be alone&quot;\n\nAs Grusinskaya, Greta Garbo clearly delivers the line &quot;I want to be alone&quot;. She insisted during a later interview[8] &quot;I only said 'I want to be let alone'. There is all the difference.&quot; This statement has been repeated in numerous articles about Garbo,[9] to the point that many people may actually believe that the line in the film was &quot;I want to be let alone&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8853cafa071eedea746ce1f0b9a3d443ee796be8","amp;dn":"Best+Picture+-+1932+-+Grand+Hotel+%28Garbo%2C+Barrymore%2C+Crawford%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8853cafa071eedea746ce1f0b9a3d443ee796be8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,83,202,250,7,30,237,234,116,108,225,240,185,163,212,67,238,121,107,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
