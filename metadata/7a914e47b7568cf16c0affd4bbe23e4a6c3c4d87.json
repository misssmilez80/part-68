Each faction has three types of basic troops, and five types of more advanced troops, with players selecting from these to form their individual army compositions.\n\nThe player controls individual heroes representative of each faction, each of whom act as avatars in alternating exploration and battle phases, growing in experience and obtaining new abilities as the game progresses.[4] The game's producers described battles as the center of the game, and these battles are turn-based.[8] Battles take place using two separate grids of troops, with enemy troops being shown on the top screen, while friendly troops are shown on the bottom screen. Each turn, players have a number of moves (generally three) with which to move individual units around on the grid (battlefield) in an effort to stack similarly colored units vertically. When the correct number of units of the same color are stacked, the units begin charging for an attack which will execute some number of turns later. If the charging units are not destroyed prior to the beginning of their attack, the attack launches vertically towards the opponent's army, interacting with any enemy units which are in the way, and possibly striking the enemy leader or hero as well.\n\nEquippable artifacts, some returning from Heroes V, are also involved in gameplay; these modify troop or hero abilities during combat.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a914e47b7568cf16c0affd4bbe23e4a6c3c4d87","amp;dn":"Might+%26amp%3B+Magic+Clash+of+Heroes+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a914e47b7568cf16c0affd4bbe23e4a6c3c4d87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,145,78,71,183,86,140,241,108,10,255,212,187,226,62,74,108,60,77,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
