The Market Profile is an ever-evolving, multidimensional graphic that gives visual form to the market\\'s continuing auction process, revealing the myriad underlying dynamics that influence market activity. Behavioral finance posits that investors are driven more by emotional factors and the subjective interpretation of minutia than by \\&quot;rationality\\&quot; when making investment decisions. And neuroeconomics is the study of how investor psychology permeates and affects the financial markets. Mr. Dalton explicates the ways in which irrational human behavior influences the market\\'s natural auction process, creating frequently predictable market structure, which results in opportunities for investors to ameliorate risk. The book will improve investors ability to interpret change in markets, enabling better, more confident investment decisions.\n\n\nYear: 2007\nPublisher: w'ley Trading\nISBN 978-0470039090 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88378f49815b10721b6b286d8000210cd54797f4","amp;dn":"Dalton+Dalton+Jones+Markets+in+Profile+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88378f49815b10721b6b286d8000210cd54797f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,55,143,73,129,91,16,114,27,107,40,109,128,0,33,12,213,71,151,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
