While this five-song set isn't flawless, as Getz has some problems with repeated reed squeaking in the rendition of &quot;Cherokee,&quot; the all-standards program is otherwise very enjoyable, with excellent sound. Getz is in total control with the lush take of &quot;Darn That Dream,&quot; as he makes a delayed entrance following pianist Andrzej Trzaskowski, who proves himself to be a thoughtful accompanist and soloist. Bassist Roman Dylag and drummer Andrzej Dabrowski also get high marks. This compilation is rounded out with two tracks from a 1974 concert in Warsaw by a working edition of the Stan Getz Quartet, with pianist Albert Dailey, bassist George Mraz, and drummer Billy Hart. The tenor saxophonist again gets a little sloppy with atypical reed squeaks in both tracks, which include an extended, exciting workout of Chick Corea's &quot;La Fiesta&quot; and an old favorite, Jobim's &quot;Desafinado.&quot; Getz fans will definitely want to acquire this obscure Polish CD. \n\n  1  But Not For Me  \n  2  Cherokee \n  3  Darm That Dream\n  4  Out Of Nowhere  \n  5  The Folks Who Live On The Hill \n  6  La Fiesta\n  7  Desafinado\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf91f8cf5dda03a3c785a3944ce755245fc15fa9","amp;dn":"Stan+Getz+Quartet+-+Stan+Getz+In+Warsaw+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf91f8cf5dda03a3c785a3944ce755245fc15fa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,145,248,207,93,218,3,163,199,133,163,148,76,231,85,36,95,193,95,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
