Bush, the 43rd U.S. President, on 19 October 2007 in Chicago, Illinois. The film is presented as a future history mockumentary and uses actors, archival video footage as well as computer-generated special effects to present the hypothetical aftermath the event had on civil liberties, racial profiling, journalistic sensationalism and foreign policy.\n\nThe central conceit of Death of a President was much criticised by those who believed it exploited the subject of presidential assassination, and that by doing so, was in bad taste. Gretchen Esell of the Texas Republican Party described the subject matter saying, &quot;I find this shocking, I find it disturbing. I don't know if there are many people in America who would want to watch something like that.&quot; Hillary Clinton, then junior United States Senator from New York, told The Journal News of Rockland, Westchester, and Putnam counties at the annual New Castle Community Day in Chappaqua that, &quot;I think it's despicable. I think it's absolutely outrageous. That anyone would even attempt to profit on such a horrible scenario makes me sick.&quot;\n\nSimon Finch, the co-screenwriter, replied saying that Clinton had not seen the film when she commented. The Bush administration did not comment about the film; as White House spokesperson Emily Lawrimore remarked, &quot;We are not commenting because it doesn't dignify a response.&quot; Two U.S. cinema chains, Regal and Cinemark, refused to screen Death of a President, which was distributed by Newmarket Films in the United States. CNN and NPR also refused to broadcast advertisements for the film.\n\nCritics had varied opinions about Death of a President. The Metacritic aggregate website rated it at 49, &quot;Mixed or Average&quot;, based upon 30 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes rated it at 37%, &quot;Rotten&quot;, based upon 90 reviews. In Time magazine, Richard Corliss said it was &quot;engrossing, but not enthralling&quot;, placing it in the context of other fictional assassinations, such as The Assassination of the Duke of Guise (1908), Suddenly (1954) and television programmes like 24 (2001ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2010); concluding that it was &quot;not an incendiary documentary, but a well-made political thriller.&quot; In the Village Voice, J. Hoberman said it was &quot;dramatically inert, but a minor techno-miracle&quot; and that it &quot;skews more theoretical than sensationalist ... Bush is presented as a martyr.&quot; James Berardinelli commented that &quot;If this was a serious examination of the possible long-term ramifications of George Bush's current foreign policy, or if it had anything interesting to say about Bush's legacy, it might be justifiable. But that's not the case. The decision to use Bush rather than a fictional representation of him is for no reason other than self-promotion.&quot;\n\nOf the critics who liked Death of a President, Rex Reed of The New York Observer identified the film as &quot;Clever, thoughtful, and totally believable. This is a film without a political agenda that everyone should see.&quot; In the Toronto Star, Peter Howell said, &quot;The film's deeper intentions ... elevate it into the company of such landmark works of historical argument as Peter Watkins's The War Game, Costa-Gavras's Z and, closer to home, Michel Brault's Les Ordres. Every thinking person should see Death of a President.&quot; In Film Journal International, Frank Lovece mused that the film's condemnation &quot;by politicians and pundits from James Pinkerton to Hillary Clinton is understandable and completely predictable: They can't not comment, so when they do, they have to play to their audiences. None of them seriously believes that this work of fiction will really make someone take a potshot at the president, and anyway, the attempt on President Ronald Reagan's life came out of a crazy guy's fascination with Jodie Foster, so you may as well decry movies starring blonde former child actresses.&quot; Jim Emerson, editor of RogerEbert.com exclaimed, &quot;Death of a President is electrifying drama, and compellingly realistic. The actors chosen for interview segments (including the mom from Freaks &amp; Geeks as a presidential speechwriter) are unerringly authentic as real people, speaking spontaneously before a documentary lens -- even when it's clear they've rehearsed in their heads what they're going to say, and may even have told these same stories any number of times before.&quot;\n\nThe film won a total of 6 awards including; the International Critics Prize (FIPRESCI) from the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, the International Emmy Award for the TV Movie/Mini-Series category in the (UK), the RTS Television Award in the Digital Channel Programme category from the Royal Television Society, the RTBF TV Prize for Best Picture Award from the Brussels European Film Festival for director Gabriel Range, the Banff Rockie Award from the Banff Television Festival for the film, and one for director Gabriel Range.
