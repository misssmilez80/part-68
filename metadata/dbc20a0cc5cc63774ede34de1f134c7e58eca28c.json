Izumo stumbles upon a boy whose father set out to face the Kraken six months before and is still missing. The boy plans to enact his revenge against the creature as he believes it killed his father, but he and the Esquires find out what really happened when they encounter it, much to their surprise. \n\n12 \t&quot;A Game of Tag&quot;\n\nThe Esquires are tasked to look for the ghost of a child that is haunting Mephisto Pheles' amusement park. Rin and Shiemi manage to find the ghost first, but Shiemi ends up chasing it by herself while Amaimon, a higher demon and another son of Satan, steals Rin's sword and forces Rin to fight with him. Meanwhile another exorcist comes to defend him, and she is revealed to be an old friend of Rin's father. \n\n13 \t&quot;Proof&quot;\n\nShura Kirigakure, a high level Exorcist and former apprentice of Father Shiro, was acting as one of Rin's classmates and was tasked to investigate his connection with Satan. With orders to kill him if it were proven true, she is divided between fulfilling her obligations and following Shiro's request to look after Rin in his place if something should happen to him. Her doubts are cleared when she confronts Rin and finds that Shiro was actually raising him as a son instead of a weapon. \n\n14 \t&quot;A Fun Camping Trip&quot;\n\nThe first semester has ended, signaling the start of summer vacation for True Cross Academy students. But thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no rest in sight for Rin and the other Esquires: first they must take part in a 3-day drill to prepare them for actual combat, under the guise of a camping trip out in the forest. \n\n15 \t&quot;Act of Kindness&quot;\n\nRin and his classmates succeed at the task gave to them by their teachers, but the camp is attacked by Amaimon, who holds Shiemi hostage to force Rin to fight. Having no option but to go full force against Amaimon, Rin is forced to reveal his secret by exposing his true form in front of his friends. With the other Esquires fleeing astonished after learning the truth about him, Rin easily overpowers Amaimon, but loses control of his flames and goes on a rampage. The Demon-Slaying Blade is cracked in the process. \n\n16 \t&quot;The Wager&quot;\n\nShiemi manages to calm down Rin, who is captured by Arthur Auguste Angel, the current paladin, and taken to the True Cross Order Headquarters in the Vatican along Shura and Mephisto Pheles. Meanwhile, Rin's classmates become astonished when Yukio reveals to them that he and his brother are sons of Satan, but offer their help regardless, and they set for Kyoto looking for the descendant of the swordsmith who forged the Demon-Slaying Blade to have it fixed. Before the Order's upper echelons, the &quot;Grigori&quot;, Mephisto states that his reason for keeping Rin alive is to have him confront Satan, and just when he is trying to convince them to agree to his plan, an enraged Amaimon breaks in, eager to confront Rin once more. \n\n17 \t&quot;Temptation&quot;\n\nEasily breaking through all defenses, Amaimon reaches the room where Rin is being held and Mephisto convinces the Grigori to agree with his plan. Using the reforged Demon-Slaying Blade brought by his classmates, Rin defeats Amaimon and the Grigori decides that he has six months to pass the Exorcist authorization exam, thus he begins a special training to learn to control his flames. Despite they helped Rin by having his sword fixed, some of his classmates still has some mixed feelings about him after learning of his connection with Satan, the most awkward of them being Konekomaru, who is approached by a dark presence attracted by his fear. \n\n18 \t&quot;Gale&quot;\n\nRin and Kamiki are attacked by an unknown enemy and Mephisto Pheles orders the Esquires to check the barriers protecting the school looking for any breach. The enemy is revealed to be a demon who took advantage of Konekomaru's fears to infiltrate the Academy. Meanwhile, Shura locates a hidden door leading to a suspicious abandoned lab. When Konekomaru's heart succumbs to the demon, his friends rush to help him, and Rin manages to slay the monster and save his life. Ashamed of causing so much trouble, Konekomaru decides to leave the Academy and return home, but Rin and the rest of his friends reach him before he departs and convince him to stay. \n\n19 \t&quot;An Ordinary Day&quot;\n\nThe Esquires learn that Kamiki's birthday is coming and they decide to make a surprise party to her. Despite all their efforts to make the party a secret, Kamiki ends up figuring the truth and claims that it should also be dedicated to those whose birthday already passed too. In the end, the party becomes a celebration to everyone's friendship. \n\n20 \t&quot;Mask&quot;\n\nRin and Yukio find that their friends from the monastery where they were raised were attacked by a masked individual who covered their entire bodies with an seemingly indestructible spider web. While pursuing the culprit, whose objective is to attack anyone related to the son of Satan to make him suffer, Yukio stumbles into Neuhaus who flees without further explanation. Despite having his sword sealed by the web, Rin insists to go after the masked one but is held back by Yukio and Shura, until he gets word that his friends, Suguro, Renzo and Konekomaru are being attacked too and rushes to help them. Before being able to intervene, Mephisto Pheles is taken away by representatives of the high order who suspect him of directing unauthorized biological research. By managing to control his flames properly, Rin defeats the attacker, who flees thanks to Neuhaus who reveals her to be his wife, and safely releases his friends.\n\nVideo Format:     mp4\n=============\n\nEnglish Subs By:  Speedy Joe\n================\n\nUploader Notes:\n===============\n                  The size of the files are very small and anyone will surely think that this is very bad quality.
