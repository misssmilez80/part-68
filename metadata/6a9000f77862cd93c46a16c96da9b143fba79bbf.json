Porteus is based on the Linux Live Scripts which have been heavily modified by Fanthom, our chief maintainer, for a much faster booting and shutdown time. In essence, Porteus is a portable Slackware OS which started out as Fanthom keeping the Slax OS up to date as a community remix project. Unlike a standard linux install, Porteus exists in a compressed state on a postable drive. It has no /root /bin /etc file structure on the portable device itself.  The directory structure is created on the fly during the boot process, which only takes around 20-30 seconds on a relatively new computer. It is modular in design which means extra software comes in the form of  'modules' which can be activated and injected into the live file system. Software does not need to be installed and uninstalled as you may expect with other operating systems which take numerous amounts of clicks and agreements. You simply double click on a module and it is activated in a second or two and ready for use. To remove it just double click again and the module is deactivated. It's that simple!  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://porteus.org/faq.html#1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://porteus.org/faq.html#1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPorteus-v1.1-rc2 is released!\n\nPostby brokenman  22 Nov 2011, 03:09\nThe Porteus Community is pleased to announce a new development release, Porteus Version 1.1, RC2.
