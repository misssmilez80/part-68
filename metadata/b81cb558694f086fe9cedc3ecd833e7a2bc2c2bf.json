The band's music has evolved from fast-paced indie rock in the vein of their most obvious influences The Fall, Buzzcocks and Gang of Four to more varied forms. Throughout their career, they have been led by vocalist and guitarist David Gedge, the band's only constant member.\n\nTo my knowledge, this is a complete collection of all The Wedding Present album releases and compilations spanning the years 1984 - 1996 (and a few later Peel session). If you know of any tracks or releases missing from this complilation, let me know in the comments and I'll try and track them down.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b81cb558694f086fe9cedc3ecd833e7a2bc2c2bf","amp;dn":"The+Wedding+Present+1984+-+1996","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b81cb558694f086fe9cedc3ecd833e7a2bc2c2bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,28,181,88,105,79,8,111,233,206,220,62,205,131,62,122,43,194,194,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
