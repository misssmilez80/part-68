Cynical teacher Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz) hates her job. She canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t wait for the day she finds a man who makes enough cash to let her walk away from her life of middle-school misery, and when her fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© cancels their wedding plans, her frantic search intensifies. Just when it starts to look like Elizabeth will have to muscle her way through another semester of skull-crushing hangovers, however, handsome substitute Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) shows up at school sporting a fancy wristwatch and the promise of a care-free future. But in order to earn her meal ticket, Elizabeth will have to out-cute perky fellow teacher Amy (Lucy Punch). And it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be easy, because Scott is crushing on Amy hard. Now, if Elizabeth can just motivate her students to study so that she can win a state contest to earn enough cash for some new breast implants, perhaps she can finally find a means of diverting ScottÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gaze. Meanwhile, much to ElizabethÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chagrin, wisecracking, self-effacing gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel) refuses to admit defeat despite being turned down for a date by his gold-digging colleague time and again.\n\n\nCast :\nCameron Diaz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Elizabeth Halsey\nLucy Punch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Amy Squirrel\nJason Segel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Russell Gettis\nJustin Timberlake ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Scott Delacorte\nPhyllis Smith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Lynn Davies\nJohn Michael Higgins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Principal Wally Snur\nDave Allen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Sandy Pinkus (as Dave ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GruberÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Allen)\nJillian Armenante ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Ms. Pavicic\nMatthew J.

Doing so reduces the strain on the CPU and allows for \n even High Definition content to be played on a relatively weak system. \n\n\nAudio Info : \n- Format/Info......: AC-3  (Audio Coding 3)\n- Format profile...: CM (complete main)\n- Bit rate.........: 448 Kbps\n- Channel(s).......: 6 channels   \n- Channel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\n- Sampling rate....: 48.0 KHz   \n\n\n\n\n\n # Cheers to the support for this release by  : http://www.chociz.com/\n # Follow the Releases from   :\n\n [img]http://torrent-stats.info/98db/eda512db.png[/img]\n \n  \n  \n # QUALiTY AT iT's BEST #\n      \n\t  M  X  M  G\n\n[IMG]http://lookpic.com/c1/i2/1336/v1jTC2Qo.png[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7cf78993c56a85832ad98db4a1b94743dec3f7a","amp;dn":"Bad+Teacher+2011+BRRip+720p+x264+DXVA-MXMG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7cf78993c56a85832ad98db4a1b94743dec3f7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,207,120,153,60,86,168,88,50,173,152,219,74,27,148,116,61,236,63,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
