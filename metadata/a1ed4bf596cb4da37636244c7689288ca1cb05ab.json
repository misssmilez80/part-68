What the film tries to capture is that musical magic created when kids come together and perform with their hearts and souls. The story is essentially a simple one about a school show, and the plot centres around a burnt down school hall, an ill judged affair and the everyday trials and tribulations of teenage life. \n\nGenre: Drama \nIMDB rating: 6.6/10 \nDirected by: Marc Evans \nStarring: Minnie Driver, Aneurin Barnard and Danielle Branch \n\nRelease Name: Hunky.Dory.2011.DVDRiP.XviD-UNVEiL \nSize: 2 CD \nVideo: XViD, 640Ãƒâ€”272, 1 397 Kbps, 25.000 fps \nAudio: English, AC3, 448Kbps \nRuntime: 1h 45mn\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ed4bf596cb4da37636244c7689288ca1cb05ab","amp;dn":"Hunky.Dory.2011.DVDRiP.XviD-UNVEiL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ed4bf596cb4da37636244c7689288ca1cb05ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,237,75,245,150,203,77,163,118,54,36,76,118,137,40,140,161,203,5,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
