What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 9 - Wednesday - The remaining amateur chefs get to live out what most professional chefs only dream of doing in their careers. The contestants need to create two pop up restaurants from scratch. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:111c999db6112d8d748498fef0ebd01ccb70fcbf","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E52.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"111c999db6112d8d748498fef0ebd01ccb70fcbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,28,153,157,182,17,45,141,116,132,152,254,240,235,208,28,203,112,252,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
