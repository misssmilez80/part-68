QPR won promotion from the Championship \nlast season, so this will be Villa's first top-flight game away to Rangers for 16 years. \nThe London club made a terrible start to life in the Premier League, suffering a 4-0 \nhome defeat to Bolton, but since then manager Neil Warnock has brought in several \nexperienced players, including ex-Villa full-back Luke Young and former Newcastle \nmidfielder Joey Barton. Villa lost two of their best players in the close season, \nwith Ashley Young sold to Manchester United and Stewart Downing departing to Liverpool. \nHowever, new manager Alex McLeish can still count on the predatory skills of England \nstriker Darren Bent, along with new summer signing Charles N'Zogbia. With analysis \nfrom guests Alan Shearer and Robbie Savage.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fcec320593e2698f2753a3badc8b3ed87ae0e9e","amp;dn":"Match+Of+The+Day+-+2+-+25th+September+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fcec320593e2698f2753a3badc8b3ed87ae0e9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,206,195,32,89,62,38,152,242,117,58,59,173,200,179,237,135,174,14,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
