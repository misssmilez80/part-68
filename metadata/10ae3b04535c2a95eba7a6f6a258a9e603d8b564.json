His allies grow. The Ringwraiths return in an even more frightening form. Saruman's army of Uruk Hai is ready to launch an assault against Aragorn and the people of Rohan. Yet, the Fellowship is broken and Boromir is dead. For the little hope that is left, Frodo and Sam march on into Mordor, unprotected. A number of new allies join with Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin and Merry. And they must defend Rohan and attack Isengard. Yet, while all this is going on, Sauron's troops mass toward the City of Gondor, for the War of the Ring is about to begin.\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\npal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10ae3b04535c2a95eba7a6f6a258a9e603d8b564","amp;dn":"The+lord+of+the+rings%3AThe+two+towers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10ae3b04535c2a95eba7a6f6a258a9e603d8b564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,174,59,4,83,92,42,149,235,167,166,246,162,88,169,230,3,216,181,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
