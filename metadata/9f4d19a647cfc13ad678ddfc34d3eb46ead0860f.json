You suck!&quot; comments) but I decided to try and sync some English audio I got of this film (recorded with a microphone, not line audio or anything) to some camera footage already available. Unfortunately I only got the second half of the movie's audio recorded, but I guess you could use this copy to remissness on scenes you saw when you went to see this film in the cinema. It starts about an hour in.\n\nI used two different sources in this, one is most of the footage, but it had some small scenes missing so I used another copy to replace them. The other version still didn't have all of what I needed to fill in the blank in a spot, so there's a few minutes of a black screen at once point. Thought I might as well keep the audio so you can hear it anyway! The second source I used was way too dark so I put the brightness/contrast up a bit, but the footage for the whole video is still kinda bad. I can tell what's going on but I saw it in the cinema, YMMV. Most of the footage is unedited.\n\nI also re-compressed it into a H.264/AAC and got it quite small as the original footage isn't very high quality to begin with.\n\nI mainly put this up to see what people thought of my attempt at what I did. If you do like it, tell me and I may be able to do the whole thing, although I imagine someone else will get there before me. I actually think there's one up right now that is the whole film, but I have yet to finish downloading it to find out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f4d19a647cfc13ad678ddfc34d3eb46ead0860f","amp;dn":"%28Second+Half+of%29+The+Amazing+Spider-Man+%5BCAM%5D+%28for+Feedback%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f4d19a647cfc13ad678ddfc34d3eb46ead0860f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,77,25,166,71,207,193,58,214,120,221,252,52,211,235,70,234,208,134,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
