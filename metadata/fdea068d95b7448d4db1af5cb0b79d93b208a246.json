Last Train Home takes viewers on a heart-stopping journey with the Zhangs, a couple who left infant children behind for factory jobs 16 years ago, hoping their wages would lift their children to a better life. They return to a family growing distant and a daughter longing to leave school for unskilled work. As the Zhangs navigate their new world, Last Train Home paints a rich, human portrait of ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rush to economic development. An EyeSteelFilm production in association with ITVS International. A co-presentation with the Center for Asian American Media. An Official Selection of the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Winner of Best Feature-Length Documentary Award, 2009 International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam.\nChina's booming economy depends on the single largest migrant work force in the world: 240 million people who have left their homes and villages to seek work in urban factories. The scale of this internal migration, and the social turmoil it brings, is never more visible than in the workers' annual return to their families and villages for Chinese New Year. So many millions on the move is a testament to the determination of Chinese workers to reconnect with family and tradition. It also exposes a nation under stress from rapid economic development and massive social change.Among those millions are husband and wife Zhang Changhua and Chen Suqin who, 16 years earlier, left their village in Sichuan Province ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and left their children in the care of grandparents ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to work in the city of Guangzhou, 1,300 miles away. Their contact with their children was reduced largely to telephone calls and the annual New Year's reunion. While the great spaces of China, alternately empty or crowded with anxious tides of people, are always present, Last Train Home is most intimately the story of the Zhang family, who are fated to reach for the promise of the new China and discover its wrenching cost.\n\nTechnical Specs for SD XviD\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1304 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 86.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 893 MB\nEncoded Harry65\nSource: HDTV\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdea068d95b7448d4db1af5cb0b79d93b208a246","amp;dn":"PBS.POV.Last.Train.Home.2011.PDTV.XviD.AC3.MVGroup.Forum.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdea068d95b7448d4db1af5cb0b79d93b208a246","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,234,6,141,149,183,68,141,77,177,175,92,176,183,157,147,178,8,162,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
