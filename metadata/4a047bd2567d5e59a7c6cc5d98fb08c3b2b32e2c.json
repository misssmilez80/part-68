Its goal is to find, test, diagnose and repair disk drive problems, report and display SSD and HDD health, performance degradations and failures. Hard Disk Sentinel gives complete textual description, tips and displays/reports the most comprehensive information about the hard disks and solid state disks inside the computer or in external enclosures (USB / e-SATA). Many different alerts and report options are available to ensure maximum safety of your valuable data.\n\nThe software monitors hard disk drive / HDD status, including health, temperature and all S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology, built in most hard disks and solid state disks today) values for each disks. Also it measures the disk transfer speed in real time which can be used as a benchmark or to detect possible hard disk failures, performance degradations.\n\nHDSentinel is the perfect data protection solution: it can be effectively used to prevent HDD failure and SSD / HDD data loss because it has the most sensitive disk health rating system which is extremely sensitive to disk problems. This way even a small HDD problem can't be missed. The Professional version has scheduled and automatic (on-problem) disk backup options to prevent data loss caused by not only failure but by malware or accidental delete also.\n\n\nFeatures:\n==========\nEasy to use interface:\n-----------------------\nAll information are displayed in the main window of the application. Quick controls allow easy navigation to access all hard disks, partitions and different information. Intuitive user interface elements display information by using green/yellow/red color to indicate the level of problem. Detailed text description and context sensitive help guides the user thru the features and options.\n\n1. Install &gt; 2. Configure &gt; 3. Stay protected:\n-----------------------------------------------\nJust install, configure alerts and backup functions and your system is now safe. You'll be notified about the problems - but if everything is correct, Hard Disk Sentinel just sits on tray and displays current status. The data is protected 24 hours daily, 7 days a week.\n\nDisk Management:\n-----------------\nControl Advanced Power Management level and adjust Free Fall Control sensitivity of hard disks to maximise hard disk performance and data safety.\n\nBackup:\n--------\nWide range of automatic backup methods are available: to backup data to local computer, to a LAN server or to a remote server by transferring files via FTP (or even by e-mail). It is possible to use 3rd party tools to create archives or burn CD/DVD media. Hard Disk Sentinel Professional can manage power status of remote computers in the network, so it is possible to automatically power on and shut down remote computers, for example a backup server.\n\nAPI Interface For Developers:\n-------------------------------\nWith the API it is possible to query detected hard disk information from the software. This way 3rd party software can log, display or otherwise process detected disk information including temperature, health and so.\n\nRemote Monitoring:\n-------------------\nHard Disk Sentinel Professional offers extensive remote monitoring capabilities. Hard disk status can be checked remotely by a web browser, even by a mobile phone or a PDA.\n\nInstant S.M.A.R.T. analysing:\n------------------------------\nHard Disk Sentinel can communicate with IDE, Serial ATA, SCSI and most USB HDD and SSD to detect their status and temperature. Disk status are displayed immediately as you launch the application, there is no need to analyse disks for a long period. It displays the current and maximum temperature for the hard disk. It reads all general and vendor-specific attributes and monitor their values. For advanced users, all raw data are displayed also including power-on time and number of read/write errors. Hard Disk Sentinel interprets the performance and fitness related S.M.A.R.T. values and displays the calculated Performance and Health percentage, total power on time and estimated lifetime remaining.\n\nHard Disk Hardware and Software Tests:\n---------------------------------------\nBy using Hard Disk Sentinel, it is possible to start hardware hard disk self tests. These tests can be used to effectively find all hard disk problems because built-in hardware methods are used to verify hard disk components (for example heads, servo, internal buffer in the Short self test). The Extended self test also verifies the complete disk surface, finds and repairs all weak areas and re-allocates the possible bad sectors. This is not possible with the software-based disk surface scan methods (for example, by using scandisk).\n\nSeek Noise Test:\n-----------------\nSeek Test - to verify hard disk noise, seek time performance and temperature. Longer tests can be used as very deep and intensive stress-tests for the disk system and useful to verify if additional cooling is required.\n\nEnhanced Disk Tests:\n---------------------\nSurface Test - to verify hard disk surface with intensive disk testing methods to reveal and fix disk problems. Surface reinitialisation resets all sectors to factory default states. Different destructive and non-destructive tests are available to re-fresh the condition of any hard disks, solid state disks or even your pendrives or memory cards.\n\nLogging:\n---------\nHard Disk Sentinel logs all degradations in all SMART parameters and issues alerts in such cases to maximise data protection. For example, if a new bad sector is found on your hard disk, you will be notified.\n\nAlerts:\n--------\nHard Disk Sentinel has wide range of alerts upon different problems. It can send e-mail (with e-mail-&gt;SMS gateway it can be SMS warning to your mobile), network message, can play sound alerts and so.It can execute various tasks (automatic panic backup or any configured external applications) in case of a problem.There is an option to send daily emails about current status.\n\nShutdown:\n----------\nOffers option to shut down the computer on hard disk failure, HDD overheat or health degradation. This option can be used in combination of the alerts to prevent further data loss.\n\nHard Disk Details:\n-------------------\nDetects and displays every information about the hard disk, from the revision number and buffer size to all features it has. The maximum available and current transfer modes are also displayed.\n\nHDD status in Windows Explorer:\n--------------------------------\nView the current health status and used space in Windows Explorer or in any other application, so you'll always know the amount of used space for each partitions and the disk condition.\n\nInformation on demand:\n-----------------------\nCurrent hard disk temperatures and health are displyed on the system tray and can be displayed in a small status window, the desktop itself or in a sidebar gadget (under Windows Vista or newer operating system). Average and maximum temperatures are logged for all hard disks and these informations are displayed in graphs for statistical purposes.\n\nHard Disk Performance:\n-----------------------\nLogs how much data were read from or written to the hard disk. Displays current transfer rates for both reading and writing and estimates the maximum available (theoretical) transfer rate for a particular hard disk.\n\nHard Disk Partitions:\n----------------------\nDisplays partitions for each physical hard disks and type and usage informations about them so you cannot run out of space. Hard Disk Sentinel sends this information automatically in alert/status messages.\n\nAcoustic Management:\n---------------------\nOffers option to control the acoustic level of IDE/S-ATA hard disk. It is possible to increase performance or make the disks more silent. Unique feature: control the acoustic level of your external USB hard disk (if your USB enclosure is equipped with proper USB-ATA bridge chip which supports this feature).\n\nClock Synchronization:\n-----------------------\nIt offers option to synchronize the PC clock with an atomic clock via NTP (Network Time Protocol).\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n======================\n-Pentium or compatible CPU\n-32 megabytes of system memory\n-15 megabytes of hard disk space\n-Windows operating system (Windows 95, 98, 98SE, ME, NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, 2008, Vista, Windows 7, Windows Home Server) both 32 and 64 bit versions\n-System administrator account (in service mode, it is possible to use without administrator rights and without even user logged in)\n-One or more hard disk or solid state disk with ATA (IDE or Serial ATA/SATA II), SCSI, SAS, USB interface.\nUSB hard disk support depends on the USB-ATA bridge chips.\nOther type of external disks (USB or IEEE 1394) are NOT supported because the hard disk controller chip in the external enclosure does not support the detection of S.M.A.R.T. information.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nTested And Working...\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n\n(If You Found Something &quot;Un-Clean&quot; In Any Of My Torrents, Consider That It May Be A False Positive(Alert) And If you Are Sure Please Report It To Me So I Would Remove It)\n\n[Please Leave A Comment Confirming This Pack]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a047bd2567d5e59a7c6cc5d98fb08c3b2b32e2c","amp;dn":"Hard+Disk+Sentinel+Pro+v3.70+%2B+Key+%5BChattChitto+RG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a047bd2567d5e59a7c6cc5d98fb08c3b2b32e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,4,123,210,86,125,94,89,167,198,204,93,152,251,8,195,178,179,46,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
