Space vehicles may soon take off from international airports and refuel in space. New technologies could allow flights to take off regularly between the Earth and the Moon. The technical details presented explain precisely how all this can be accomplished within the next few decades. This book also explains why the Space Tourist market could easily become the single most important factor in the mid-term future development of space transportation. In a few years it will be possible to board a spaceplane and fly into Earth orbit, and perhaps visit a space station. Later development could include refuelling in orbit to take a tour of cislunar space. The book's solid engineering foundation will be of interest to both space exploration enthusiasts and future space travelers.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 256 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (December 12, 2008)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0387765093\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0387765099","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:936d22ccadc28698bace8ed0508cac8338e0f5b0","amp;dn":"Spaceplanes%3A+From+Airport+to+Spaceport%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"936d22ccadc28698bace8ed0508cac8338e0f5b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,109,34,204,173,194,134,152,186,206,142,208,80,140,172,131,56,224,245,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
