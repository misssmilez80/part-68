On the evaluation side, the authors review the use of MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional MRI, and three-dimensional MRI, and consider the rapidly developing body of pathologic information they have yielded. On the treatment side, the focus is on recently approved medications (Novantrone), new indications for medications (CHAMPS Trial), medications in development (Oral Interferon Tau, Oral Copaxone, and Oral Cellcept), immunosuppressive therapy for both progressive disease and symptomatic therapy; the current medications for treating relapsing-remitting MS (Avonex, Betaseron, and Copaxone) are also discussed. For future directions, the authors present the current best thinking, as well as the latest discoveries in immunology relating to MS, including groundbreaking B-cell research and its applications to specific immunotherapies, and the use of immune markers for tracking the disease.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 264 pages\n    * Publisher: Humana Press; Softcover reprint of hardcover 1st ed. 2005 edition (December 8, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1617373168\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1617373169","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:792292ce60afa005938bbad24fc23be412b37d57","amp;dn":"Multiple+Sclerosis%3AEtiology%2CDiagnosis%2CTreatment+Strategies%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"792292ce60afa005938bbad24fc23be412b37d57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,34,146,206,96,175,160,5,147,139,186,210,79,194,59,228,18,179,125,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
