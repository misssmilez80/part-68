Real Love\n2. Baby's In Black\n3. Yellow Submarine\n4. Here There And Everywhere\n-----------------------------\n\n&quot;Real Love&quot; is a song written by the English rock musician John Lennon. Lennon made six takes of the song in 1979 and 1980 with &quot;Real Life&quot;, a different song that merged with &quot;Real Love&quot;. The song was ignored until 1988 when the sixth take was used on the documentary soundtrack Imagine: John Lennon.\n&quot;Real Love&quot; was subsequently reworked by the three remaining members of The Beatles (Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) in early 1995, an approach also used for another incomplete Lennon track, &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;. &quot;Real Love&quot; was released as a Beatles single in 1996 in the United Kingdom, United States and many other countries; it was the opening track on the Beatles' Anthology 2 album.\nIt is the last &quot;new&quot; credited Beatles song to originate and be included on an album. To date, it is the last single by the group to become a Top 40 hit in the US.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be7488e26ddc48fa188333121441e7e4e64b8152","amp;dn":"%5BAPE%5D+Beatles+-+Real+love+%281996%29+%5BTNTVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be7488e26ddc48fa188333121441e7e4e64b8152","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,116,136,226,109,220,72,250,24,131,51,18,20,65,231,228,230,75,129,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
