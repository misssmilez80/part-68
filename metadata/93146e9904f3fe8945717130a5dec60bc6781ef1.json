She had been playing tennis with her friends at Flinders Park. She got off the train about 10.20pm and has never been seen since. Police believe that Sarah was abducted as she walked to her 1978 red Honda civic parked in the Kananook station car park. The inquest into SarahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death was held in May 1996. Coroner Iain West found that Sarah was dead and had met her death by foul play.
