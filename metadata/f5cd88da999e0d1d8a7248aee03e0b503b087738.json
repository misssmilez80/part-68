As the ultimate experiment in manufactured image, the Gorillaz are a virtual cartoon-character-based hip-hop band who bring together witty, silly lyrics and talented musicians. Infectious old-school hip-hop rhythms, rhymes, and effects courtesy of Deltron 3030's Kid Koala and Del Tha Funkee Homosapien (Russel) are combined with Albarn's passion for chugging lo-fi and edgy melodies to create a seemingly raw but ultimately slick blend of styles. This is nowhere more evident than on the hit single &quot;Clint Eastwood,&quot; which is carried along by the sound of 2-D's slurred voice and a bluesy harmonica melody interrupted by Russel's punching rhymes. But the surprises don't stop there: Ibrahim Ferrer's appearance on &quot;Latin Simone&quot; could have come straight from Buena Vista Social Club but for the obvious Blur-influenced piano style, while the spooky intro to &quot;M1 A1&quot; wouldn't sound out of place on Michael Jackson's Thriller. Backed by Jamie Hewlett's death-wish character on bass, Cibo Matto's Miho Hatori (Noodle) on guitar and occasional hyperactive vocals, and produced by Dan &quot;the Automator&quot; Nakamura, it's hardly surprising that Gorillaz is marked both by a sense of playfulness and a passion for experimentation.\n\nSize: 118MB\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 256k\nCovers: Front and back\nTracker: prq.to/announce\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5cd88da999e0d1d8a7248aee03e0b503b087738","amp;dn":"Gorillaz+-+Gorillaz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5cd88da999e0d1d8a7248aee03e0b503b087738","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,205,136,218,153,158,13,29,138,114,72,174,224,62,11,80,59,8,119,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
