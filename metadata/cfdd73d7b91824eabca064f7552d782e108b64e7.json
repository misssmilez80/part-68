It is the sequel to the 2004-2005 release FlatOut.\nThis game is themed more on the street racing/import tuner scene than its predecessor. Another notable change is the tire grip; players can now take more control of their car, worrying less about skidding in tight turns. The game has three car classes: derby, race and street.\nIt was first released in Russia on June 29, 2006, then in Europe on June 30, 2006. The North American version was released August 1, 2006.\nOn October 3, 2008, A Mac OS X version was released by Virtual Programming.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is FlatOut 2 straight from the Mac App Store. If you have any problems running the app, please comment below. If you are asked for an Apple ID and password you may have to crack it yourself using the show package contents trick.
