Fans of this show will really enjoy this episode because 1) they're using trap cameras! 2) Ranae makes her very first 'Squatch call! 3) Bobo continues his comedic remedies, and 4) their last night of investigation turns the very skeptical Ranae into a bit more of a believer.\n \nPS3 Ready.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8b51decca540c62034cd3e8c234f0bcde4b046c","amp;dn":"Finding.Bigfoot.S02E01.Birth.of.a.Legend.720p.HDTV.x264-tNe.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8b51decca540c62034cd3e8c234f0bcde4b046c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,181,29,236,202,84,12,98,3,76,211,232,194,52,240,188,222,75,4,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
