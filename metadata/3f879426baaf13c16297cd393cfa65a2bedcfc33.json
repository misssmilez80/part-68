Private's attempts to apologise backfire when he accidentally sits and steps on Dale again, and his attempt to ask Julian for help only makes things worse when Julian supports the image of Private as a 'monster'. When Marlene attempts to find new bandages for Dale's damaged shell in the penguins' lair, Dale steals the Next-o-Skeleton and uses it to attack Private, but the subsequent fight concludes when Dale reveals that it was the Next-o-Skeleton that stepped on him, meaning that Kowalski was the guilty party rather than Private.
