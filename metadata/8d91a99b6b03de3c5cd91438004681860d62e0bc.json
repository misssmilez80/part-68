Three tons of Saddam Hussein's gold in an unguarded warehouse in Dubai. For two of Nick Stone's closest ex-SAS comrades, it was to have been the perfect, victimless crime. But when they're double-crossed and the robbery goes devastatingly wrong, only Stone can identify the guilty party... As he slowly puts the pieces together, his quest for vengeance becomes a journey to the heart of a chilling conspiracy...\n\n\nAbout The Author\nAndy McNab joined the infantry as a boy soldier. In 1984 he was 'badged' as a member of 22 SAS Regiment and was involved in both covert and overt special operations worldwide. During the Gulf War he commanded Bravo Two Zero, a patrol that, in the words of his commanding officer, 'will remain in regimental history for ever'. Awarded both the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) and Military Medal (MM) during his military career, McNab was the British Army's most highly decorated serving soldier when he finally left the SAS in February 1993. He wrote about his experiences in two phenomenal bestsellers, Bravo Two Zero, which was filmed in 1998 starring Sean Bean, and Immediate Action. He is the author of the bestselling novels, Remote Control, Crisis Four, Firewall, Last Light, Liberation Day, Dark Winter, Deep Black and Aggressor. Besides his writing work, he lectures to security and intelligence agencies in both the USA and UK.\n\n\nAbout The Reader\nPaul Thornley was born in London and trained at the Guildford School of Acting graduating with the Musical Theatre Award.
