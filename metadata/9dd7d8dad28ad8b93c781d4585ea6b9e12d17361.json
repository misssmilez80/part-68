Al-Awlaki is one of the most influential al-Qaeda operatives on the Obama administration's &quot;most wanted&quot; list. In response to news of al-Awlaki's death, constitutional scholar Glenn Greenwald and others argue the assassination of U.S. citizens without due process has now has become a reality. &quot;One of the bizarre aspects of it is that media and government reports try to sell al-Awlaki as some grand terrorist mastermind ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ describing him as the new bin Laden. The United States government needs a terrorist mastermind to replace Osama bin Laden to justify this type of endless war ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ For a while, al-Awlaki was going to serve that function,&quot; Greenwald says. &quot;If you are somebody that believes the President of the United States has the power to order your fellow citizens murdered, assassinated, killed without a shred of due process ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ then you are really declaring yourself to be as pure of an authoritarian as it gets.&quot;\n\n\n- &quot;American Teacher&quot;: New Film Rebuts Vilification of Underpaid, Dedicated Public School Teachers\n\nOpening today, the new documentary &quot;American Teacher&quot; follows the lives of four teachers who struggle to remain in a profession they love, despite the heavy toll exacted on their lives by the grueling hours and low-salaries. The documentary is a rebuttal of sorts to pundits who portray public school educators as cushioned recipients of tax-payer supported benefits, extended summer vacations and low accountability. We speak with the film's Academy Award-winning director, Vanessa Roth, and with Brooklyn first-grade public school teacher, Jamie Fidler, who is featured in the film.\n\n\n- Inside Occupy Wall St.: A Tour of Activist Encampment at the Heart of Growing Protest\n\nHundreds continue to camp out in a park in Manhattan's Financial District for the &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; protest. The encampment got a boost this week when one of New York City's largest unions, the Transit Workers Union, announced its backing. In this report ,Democracy Now! producer Mike Burke gets a tour of the private park, open to the public, that people have occupied, and and speaks with demonstrators, including a woman who was pepper sprayed by New York City Police Department Deputy Inspector Anthony Bologna last Saturday.
