Michael brings his laptop along\n        so he can work on a motion for &quot;TaintedTush.com,&quot; a website\n        Luther is representing.  Liz teases Michael by masturbating in\n        the car en route to the cabin; when they arrive, they initiate\n        sex, only to be interrupted by the arrival of the others,\n        including Preston, Judd and his date, Jackee.\n        Judd sees Michael as a rival.  He has loud sex with Jackee in\n        the room next to theirs, so Michael and Liz fake a loud\n        encounter to tease him.   Liz explains that Judd is jealous of\n        what isn't his - in this case, her.  That night, Judd gets drunk\n        and even more obnoxious.  He brings Michael's laptop, which\n        shows the TaintedTush logo, outside and drops it.  Then he\n        brings up his past affair with Liz.  The two men have words, and\n        Judd comes after Michael.  When Liz tries to intervene, Judd\n        shoves her.  Michael comes to her defense and punches Judd,\n        breaking his nose.  Michael and Liz leave.  Preston, who writes\n        in his spare time, records the incident.\n                            \n                                 \n                                                  \n      \n            \n                                                     \n                                                 \n                                                                      \n\n      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here.
