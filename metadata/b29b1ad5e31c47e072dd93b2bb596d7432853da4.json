The American Church Needs to WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP for The Sake of Jesus. Miracles from Jesus Abound in The World but The American Mass Media refuses to speak The Truth of The Holy Spirit.\n\nThis is a must see film that Includes 5 DVD's Total. Download this Bundle and See the Miracles of Jesus recorded on Film. Believe it or not, IT IS TRUE.  [/size]\n\n\nDiscription\n\n\nFinger of God began as a short film about God's miraculous power. I had no budget, no script, and no idea what this movie was ultimately going to look like. I teach storytelling and film at a University in Chicago, and here I was breaking all of my own rules.\n\nBut that's where I found myself, and I quickly discovered that God is an incredible film producer. He funded the whole film (I never had to ask for money), took me around the world, and introduced me to some truly incredible people.\n\nSo what is the film about? Well, now that it's finished, I can finally answer that question. On the surface it is about the miraculous. I originally thought I was making a film that simply tried to capture miracles on tape. But as the story progressed, things began to change.\n\nAt its core, it is about the heart of God. It's about how He views us, and how He is desperate for a relationship with us. Along the way, He places his finger on our lives, touches us deeply, heals us, shows His creativity, and generally surprises us with every move He makes.\n\nThe film's international cast includes a wide variety of people, ministries, and personalities. But just to whet your appetite, here is a partial list of some of the things you will see and hear about in this film:\nManna in the Pentagon\nAfrican children who perform miracles every day\nIncredibly rare footage of the Chinese underground church\nEastern European Gypsies radically changed by God's power\nAmazing stories of the miraculous\nHundreds raised from the dead\nGemstones appearing out of thin air\nSaddaam Hussein's old palace is now a church\nAnd much, much more.\n\n\nAbout The Director\nThe first thing people wonder when they hear about a film like this is usually, &quot;Who made it, and what's his angle?&quot; Well, my name is Darren Wilson, and Finger of God is my directorial debut. I teach Writing and Media at Judson University, which is about 30 miles west of Chicago. I have a lovely wife, Jenell, and three wonderful children, Serenity, Stryder, and River. I have an MFA in Screenwriting from Regent University, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\nSo that's me. But what about my angle? It can probably be summed up in one word. Accidental. I never intended to make this movie. To be honest, I originally didn't even want to make this movie. I had no money, I had never made a feature film before, and I didn't know anyone I needed to know. But God has a way of getting what He wants.\n\nSo I began stumbling through the process of making a movie. It began as a short film, then turned into a long film. I began to meet more and more people, began to receive more and more money from friends and family, and before long, I find myself in Istanbul, filming Heidi Baker and a Turkish Muslim trying to have a conversation, and I can't help but chuckle at God's sense of humor - as well as His sense of purpose.\n\nEvery artist has an agenda. Mine is simple. Document what God is doing in the world today, prove that He is alive and relevant, and don't bog Him down with my own preconceived ideas of how He should go about being God.\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt;                                                         Free online Bible Study &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt;                                                                End Times Prophecy - Who is Babylon the Great &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&lt;/a&gt;                                                                Pastueur Carl Gallops\n                                                                                        Listen to Alex Jones   Secular Truth &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                                      Daily Bible Study in Your Email &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                                Chuck Missler - Africa &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&lt;/a&gt;                                                          Chuck Missler - USA &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&lt;/a&gt;                                        Dehydrated Survival Food -  Excellent Taste &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&lt;/a&gt;       Chuck Missler - New Zealand, Australia, Pacific Rim\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.
