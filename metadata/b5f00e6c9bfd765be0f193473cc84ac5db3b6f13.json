It can backup your data and \nreduce the size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files \ndownloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format. \n\nHow to Extract: Extract &quot;self-extracting&quot; EXE to desired folder, launch \n&quot;WinRARPortable.exe&quot;. \n\n64-bit: Launch &quot;WinRAR64Portable.exe&quot;.\n\nNotes: \n* includes integrated &quot;Imagination 3&quot; Theme. WinRAR's default theme is so bland \nand ugly to look at. (refer to screenshot) \n* this version is truly stealth.\n* PortableAppz has a version posted but like many of his apps., it leaves trash\nin the registry and uses the standard theme.\n\nHow to Re-use:\n* I did not enforce CRC-check on this launcher thus allows re-using. \n* Why would you want to reuse? for future updates by WinRAR\n\n1. Extract WinRAR installer with 7-Zip\n2. Copy/paste into &quot;App&quot; folder\n3. Select &quot;Yes&quot; when prompted whether to replace existing files\n4. That's it.. \n\n* Do not delete the files in &quot;App&quot;, just Paste right over it.. because there are\nfiles that must remain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5f00e6c9bfd765be0f193473cc84ac5db3b6f13","amp;dn":"WinRARPortable+v4.10+Beta+2+x32+x64%3A+Portable+and+Stealth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5f00e6c9bfd765be0f193473cc84ac5db3b6f13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,240,14,108,155,253,118,91,224,241,147,71,60,200,74,197,219,59,111,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
