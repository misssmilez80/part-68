In an attempt to secure a hold on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSalesman of the Year,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Fitz takes a potential customer for a test drive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and she winds up in a coma. The accident itself unleashes something in Fitz: the last unblemished corner of his damaged soul.  Larry (Ernie Grunwald) shows up on the Fitzpatrick lot intent on rehabilitating Fitz's battered psyche and the entire Fitz family's sleazy way of life.  This is not as easy as he'd hoped, as daily events include impromptu porn shoots, black market kidney trading, sniper shakedowns, cowboy themed bachelor parties, long nights in the drunk tank and more brain damaged sex than even Fitz can handle.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all in a day's work at Fitzpatrick Motors.\n\nIn the season 2 premiere Fitz' father has his annual prostate exam and instead the doctor believes he might have testicular cancer. A fortune-teller informs Fitz that he is cursed, that someone is trying to kill him, and that he needs to make amends to everyone he has wronged. Mr Fitzpatrick hires a new office manager.\n\nCast\nJason Priestley\t ...\tRichard Fitzpatrick\nErnie Grunwald\t ...\tLarry\nTracy Dawson  \t ...\tMeghan Fitzpatrick\nAmy Sloan      \t ...\tDot Foxley\n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Call.Me.Fitz.s02e01.WS.XviD-jAh.avi\nFile size                        : 235 MiB\nDuration                         : 27mn 59s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 172 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.3 | www.virtualdub-fr.org || (build 2550/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2550/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 3\nFormat settings, QPel            : Yes\nFormat settings, GMC             : 3 warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 27mn 59s\nBit rate                         : 1 039 Kbps\nWidth                            : 624 pixels\nHeight                           : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.197\nStream size                      : 208 MiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 27mn 59s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 121 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 24.2 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 540 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings                : -m s -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a4b4a4ef16a71ea09898c39e0718bc5cb183171","amp;dn":"Call+Me+Fitz+s02e01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a4b4a4ef16a71ea09898c39e0718bc5cb183171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,75,74,78,241,106,113,234,9,137,140,57,224,113,139,197,203,24,49,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
