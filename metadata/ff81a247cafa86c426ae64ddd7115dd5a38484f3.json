Her assailant          \n    drills a hole in her skull and leaves her for dead. When the police      \n    calls Johanna's father, Morten Ravn, to ask him to identify his          \n    daughter's body in the morgue, he tells them that she has just walked    \n    in and is sitting in front of her PC... But there's something wrong      \n    with Johanna. Black oil is flowing from her eyes and the only message    \n    she's able to type on her screen is one long cry for help. And she's     \n    not alone. All over town, people are attacked by men in orange           \n    jumpsuits with electrical drills. The victims all suffer from the        \n    same symptoms, with their bodies slowly disintegrating in front of       \n    their loved ones. Frustrated with the lack of results from the local     \n    police, Morten takes it on himself to investigate the attacks and        \n    tracks the killer back to his hideout in secluded manufacturing plant    \n    where he begins to uncover the secrets behind the assaults and piece     \n    together the mysteries surrounding the killer. -The ruthless greed       \n    and ecological devastation of the oil industry form the backdrop to      \n    DARK SOULS, a satirical and stylish horror which uses homage as a        \n    springboard for its original take on the genre.                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
