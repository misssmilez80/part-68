It was released in the UK and was very successful, with hits such as &quot;Runaway Boys,&quot; &quot;Stray Cat Strut,&quot; and &quot;Rock This Town.&quot;\n\n&quot;Storm the Embassy&quot; is about the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-80 and may be the only time the Stray Cats recorded a political song.\n\nThis album has never been released in the United States. Six of the songs from it, including the hits &quot;Stray Cat Strut&quot; and &quot;Rock This Town&quot;, were issued on the band's first American album Built for Speed.\n\nStray Cats are an American Rockabilly band formed in 1980 by guitarist/vocalist Brian Setzer (Bloodless Pharaohs/Brian Setzer Orchestra), bassist Lee Rocker and Slim Jim Phantom (drums) in the Long Island town of Massapequa, New York. The group had numerous hit singles in the UK, Australia and the U.S. including &quot;Stray Cat Strut&quot;, &quot;Sexy and 17&quot;, &quot;I Won't Stand in Your Way&quot;, &quot;Bring it Back Again&quot;, and &quot;Rock This Town&quot;, which the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has listed as one of the 500 most important songs in the history of rock and roll.\n\nThe group, whose style was based upon the sounds of Sun Records artists and other artists from the 1950s, were heavily influenced by Eddie Cochran, Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent and Bill Haley &amp; His Comets. The Stray Cats quickly developed a large following in the New York music scene playing at CBGB and Max\\'s Kansas City as well as venues on Long Island. When the Cats heard a rumor that there was a revival of the 1950s Teddy Boy youth subculture in England, the band moved to the UK. They then spearheaded the nascent rockabilly revival, by blending the 1950s Sun Studio sound with modern punk musical elements. In terms of visual style the Stray Cats also blended elements of 1950 rockabilly clothes such as wearing drape jackets, brothel creepers and western shirts with punk clothes such as tight black zipper trousers and modern versions of 1950s hair styles.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stray_Cats_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stray_Cats_(album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PaKlkaAdg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PaKlkaAdg&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:01\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
