Both a CD buyer's guide and a who's who, the guide includes concise biographical profiles of more than 200 composers and informative summaries of the major compositions in all genres, from chamber works to operatic epics. For novices and experts alike, the fully updated fifth edition features contemporary composer Helmut Lachenmann and Widor, the 19th century organ composer of 'Toccata' wedding fame, as well as dozens more works added for existing composers. You'll find an new 'Top 10's' section with accessible introductory listings including the Top 10 operas and the Top 10 symphonies plus new essay boxes on topics such as 'Baroque - a style or a period?' and 'The clarinet comes of age'. &quot;The Rough Guide to Classical Music&quot; features fresh and incisive reviews of hundreds of CDs, selecting the very best of the latest recordings and reissues as well as more than 150 illustrations of composers and performers, including a rare archive of photos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8db9f95ebaf812d66fbfa7fbb4878107a268d64a","amp;dn":"The+Rough+Guide+To+Classical+Music+%285e%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8db9f95ebaf812d66fbfa7fbb4878107a268d64a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,185,249,94,186,248,18,214,111,191,167,251,180,135,129,7,162,104,214,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
