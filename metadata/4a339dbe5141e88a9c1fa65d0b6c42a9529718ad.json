So I've decided to do a torrent from my own copy . \nYou can find the cs3 version of the book used on amazon for only a couple of bucks but most don't have the included dvd . \nPhotoshop CS3 is the last version that can run on a minimal hardware setup and is by far the most stable. So if you learn this you can easily get to grips on the latest cs5.5 version which I've used and hate. \nIf you edit a lot of photographs lightroom is a better solution anyway\nSo here you are the complete content of the dvd(minus the fluff demo plug-ins which)\nMost of the navigation can be done within your browser of choice by way of Start.html . However if  the .flv video files won't start playing automatically  go to Help_Guide/movies . \nSame goes for .pdf or other formats not supported by your browser\nplease seed, Thanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a339dbe5141e88a9c1fa65d0b6c42a9529718ad","amp;dn":"Adobe+Photoshop+CS3+for+photographers+Martin+Evening+companion+D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a339dbe5141e88a9c1fa65d0b6c42a9529718ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,51,157,190,81,65,232,138,156,31,166,93,11,108,66,169,82,151,24,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
