Prime Minister Tony\n                Blair, is wanted for murder and on the run. Escaping\n                from Number 10 and leaving behind his adoring wife\n                Cherie, Tony vows to clear his name no matter what\n                the consequences. But on a foggy London night, Tony\n                has few friends willing to harbour a wanted man.\n                With front pages demanding his capture, Blair has no\n                choice but to go on the run, with Inspector Hutton\n                and his sidekick hot on his trail. The chase unfolds\n                thanks to evidence gleaned from his 'allies'\n                Mandelson and Brown, as well as an unlikely\n                encounter with Margaret Thatcher. Surely Tony's an\n                innocent man, pursued for a crime he didn't commit?\n                The cast also includes Harry Enfield as Alastair\n                Campbell, Rik Mayall as Professor Predictor, Morgana\n                Robinson as Carole Caplin, John Sessions as\n                Thatcher's butler and Ross Noble as an 'old Labour'\n                tramp.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b6a27cccaa409f0417f48562504ee80112fb2cb","amp;dn":"The.Comic.Strip.Presents.The.Hunt.For.Tony.Blair.720p.HDTV.x264-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b6a27cccaa409f0417f48562504ee80112fb2cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,106,39,204,202,164,9,240,65,127,72,86,37,4,238,128,17,47,178,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
