Alas for them, it ended up following a second Mahjong Solitaire game from G5 Entertainment (G5 also had one at the launch of the Minis program), so it has some stiff competition.\nMahjong solitaire is pretty simple. You take a set of mahjong tiles and lay them out in a pattern. Then you remove matched pairs that are free (only touching another tile on one end) until you can either make no more moves, or youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve finished removing all the tiles. Doing it in real life is no doubt a lot of work though. Which is why itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s much more popular virtually.\n\nIf you like Mahjong Solitaire, this does get the job done, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a little barebones. Certainly in terms of options and value, either of the Solitaire Mahjong titles from G5 has this beat. They have more tile sets, a hundred different layouts and no limit limit, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just the Classic Mode, not counting the storyline.\nOn the other hand, this is good if you want a more classic form of Mahjong Solitaire and one that is timed. The G5 titles use some very creative layouts as opposed to traditional ones, and generally more than 144 tiles, which could turn some people off. So this is a good alternative, it does things almost completely different. But unless you are a purist, I think the G5 ones are simply more fun and a better value.\nScore: 6/10\n\nthnxxxx Tested and working on PSP[Model-4g] 6.60PRO-B9\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:083ce2a2e4aa490040dfbf6cccd073c3ee5d84b4","amp;dn":"%5BPSP-MINIS%5D+Mahjong+Solitaire+%5BUSA%5D%5BENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"083ce2a2e4aa490040dfbf6cccd073c3ee5d84b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,60,226,162,228,170,73,0,64,223,191,108,204,208,115,195,238,93,132,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
