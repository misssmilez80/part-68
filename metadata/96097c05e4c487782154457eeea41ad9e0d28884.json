With bandwidth these days it is no a big deal to download the original files from the CD.\n\nAn absolutely wonderful program of Handel operatic arias and duets, sung with great style by two underrated artists. This is one of my favorite albums of all time. The duet from Rodelinda is in itself worth the price of the disc, a sublime performance if there ever was one. Susie LeBlanc also pulls off one of the best recordings of the famous aria from Rinaldo, &quot;Lascia Ch'io Pianga&quot;. Daniel Taylor has one of the most attractive countertenor voices to be heard today. An essential addition to any collection of Handel opera arias.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96097c05e4c487782154457eeea41ad9e0d28884","amp;dn":"Handel+Love+Duets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96097c05e4c487782154457eeea41ad9e0d28884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,9,124,5,228,196,135,120,33,84,69,126,238,164,26,217,224,210,136,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
