Middle-class kids, in their 20s, talk trash, wave guns, hang out in a pack. Johnny Truelove, drug dealer and son of a underworld figure, threatens Jake Mazursky, an explosive head case who owes Johnny money; Jake responds by breaking into Johnny's house. On impulse, Johnny and a couple pals kidnap Jake's 15-year-old brother, Zach. Zach's okay with it, figuring his brother will pay the debt soon. Johnny assigns his buddy Frankie to be Zach's minder, and they develop a brotherly friendship. Zach parties with his captors as things begin to spin out of control. Group think, amorality, and fear of prison assert a hold on the pack. Is Zach in danger?\n\nHigh quality movie in a low file size for iPhone and iPod:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/paphaaadj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/paphaaadj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/paphcaadj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/paphcaadj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:373edfbece0bf87b5f0c31ce895d358b3c13dc17","amp;dn":"Alpg.2006.480p.iPhone.Hex.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"373edfbece0bf87b5f0c31ce895d358b3c13dc17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,62,223,190,206,11,248,123,95,12,49,206,137,93,53,139,60,19,220,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
