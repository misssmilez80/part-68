This includes most machines with Intel/AMD/etc type processors and almost all computers that run Microsoft Windows, as well as newer Apple Macintosh systems based on Intel processors. Choose this if you are at all unsure.\n\n64-bit PC (AMD64) install/live DVD \nChoose this to take full advantage of computers based on the AMD64 or EM64T architecture (e.g., Athlon64, Opteron, EM64T Xeon, Core 2). If you have a non-64-bit processor made by AMD, or if you need full support for 32-bit code, use the Intel x86 images instead.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57d6c94b770063c3ec5f9416da052964e5d08f61","amp;dn":"Edubuntu+11.10+%28Oneiric+Ocelot%29+amd64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57d6c94b770063c3ec5f9416da052964e5d08f61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,214,201,75,119,0,99,195,236,95,148,22,218,5,41,100,229,208,143,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
