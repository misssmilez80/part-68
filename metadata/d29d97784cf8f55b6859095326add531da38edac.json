Instead it's Lord Rowcester -- Jeeves has been lent out while Bertie is off to school learning to be more self reliant.\n\nThe plot is typical Wodehouse, fast and convoluted, but it's the wonderful reading by Nigel Lambert that prompts me to write this review. I consider myself a most excellent reader, but now I know I'm not worthy to fill the great man's water glass. He is superb! I didn't realize anyone could 'voice' characters that way, even the female ones! Nigel makes the book come alive, and I suspect, though I'm loathe to admit it, that it's better having Nigel read a book to you than to read it for yourself. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d29d97784cf8f55b6859095326add531da38edac","amp;dn":"Ring+for+Jeeves+-+P.+G.+Wodehouse++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d29d97784cf8f55b6859095326add531da38edac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,157,151,120,76,248,245,91,104,89,9,83,38,173,213,49,218,56,237,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
