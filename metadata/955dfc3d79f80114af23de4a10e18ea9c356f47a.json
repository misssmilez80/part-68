Also tonight, Cesc is back.\n\nThe visitors at the Camp Nou tonight are Sevilla, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œone of the big teams in La LigaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, according to FCB coach Pep Guardiola  . The game brings together the teams currently lying in first and fourth place in the league table. \n\nBarcelona have been on stunning home form in the championship so far, where they have scored 21 goals in four games and not conceded any. \n\nCesc returns \n\nBarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a can welcome back Cesc FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â bregas  this evening after he was declared fully recovered from his hamstring injury on Friday. The only players still sidelined are PiquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Alexis and Afellay. Reserve player Isaac Cuenca, who made his Champions League debut on Wednesday, has been involved in training sessions with the first team this week and may be back in the team to face Sevilla in what will be the third game for the Catalans at the Camp Nou in just seven days. \n\nTwo tight defences \n\nBarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a and Sevilla, along with Levante, are the only teams that have yet to lose a game in the league. The Catalan and Andalusian sides also have incredible records in defence. VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ctor ValdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s has just kept five consecutive clean sheets in league and Champions League matches, while Javi Varas picked the ball out of the net last week for the first time in 443 minutes. Along with MunÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºa of Levante (3 goals) these are the goalkeepers with the finest records in the championship. \n\nThree major absentees \n\nMarcelino GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a Toral is arriving at the Camp Nou without three very important players, namely the suspended Spahic and the injured Perotti and Negredo. Sevilla have drawn all three of their road games so far this season.\n\n(Text written by Jordi Clos, extracted from official F.C Barcelona web page &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/futbol/temporada_11-12/arxiu_partits/lliga/jornada09/Barcelona_Sevilla/partit.html)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/futbol/temporada_11-12/arxiu_partits/lliga/jornada09/Barcelona_Sevilla/partit.html)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:955dfc3d79f80114af23de4a10e18ea9c356f47a","amp;dn":"F.C+Barcelona+vs+Sevilla+F.C.+La+Liga+2011-12.+%2810-22-11%29+First+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"955dfc3d79f80114af23de4a10e18ea9c356f47a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,93,252,61,121,248,1,20,175,35,222,74,16,225,142,169,195,86,244,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
