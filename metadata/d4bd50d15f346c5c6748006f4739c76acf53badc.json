The Power of the Shinigami!&quot;\n\nAs his last day of school ends, Ichigo is upset to discover that no one except for Orihime, Chad and UryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â« seems to remember Rukia, due to a mind wipe imposed by the Soul Society. He begins his training at the Urahara Shop, first battling the shop's girl assistant, Ururu Tsumugiya to regain control of his spirit body. As the training enters stage two, Ichigo's soul is cut from his body and thrown into a pit. He must regain his Soul Reaper powers within three days, or risk becoming a hollow. Meanwhile, Yoruichi ShihÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½in, a talking cat, offers to train Chad and Orihime to control and enhance their powers so they can join Ichigo to go to the Soul Society and rescue Rukia.\n\nUploader Notes:\n============\n\nUse VLC Player for best results.\n\nSeed and enjoy... :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4bd50d15f346c5c6748006f4739c76acf53badc","amp;dn":"Bleach+Ep.18+%28Eng.+Sub%29+%5BSpeedy+Joe%5D+%28480p%29+%5BPirateBoyTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4bd50d15f346c5c6748006f4739c76acf53badc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,189,80,209,95,52,108,92,103,72,0,111,71,57,199,106,207,83,186,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
