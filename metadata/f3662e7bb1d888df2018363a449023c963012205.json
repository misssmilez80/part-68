He was born in Dawson, Georgia, and later moved to\nMacon, Georgia, where he began touring with blues guitarist Johnny Jenkins and served as\nthe lead singer in the band Otis Redding and The Pinetoppers. He signed a contract with\nrecord label Stax Records and released his debut album Pain in My Heart in 1964. This\nalbum produced several successful singles, including &quot;These Arms of Mine&quot;.\n\nAlthough he was not very successful among white audiences in the United States, the\nopposite was true in Europe. His performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 was one\nof his last big concerts until his death in a plane crash at the age of 26. One month later,\n&quot;(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; was released, which sold about 4 million copies worldwide\nand would be his biggest hit. Redding is seen to be one of the major figures in soul R&amp;B and\nthis eventually resulted in the honorific nickname &quot;King of Soul&quot; a title also given to \nAmerican musicians James Brown and Sam Cooke.\n\n\n[Disc 1]\n\n  01 - SittinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ On / The Dock Of The Bay         [02:46]\n  02 - Hard To Handle                           [02:20]\n  03 - The Happy Song [Dum-Dum]                 [02:42]\n  04 - Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)                [02:42]\n  05 - Tramp - [Duet With Carla Thomas]         [02:58]\n  06 - Knock On Wood - [Duet With Carla Thomas] [02:47]\n  07 - Day Tripper                              [02:43]\n  08 - Try A Little Tenderness                  [03:19]\n  09 - My LoverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Prayer                        [03:06]\n  10 - Let Me Come On Home                      [02:53]\n  11 - Pain In My Heart                         [02:25]\n  12 - These Arms Of Mine                       [02:32]\n  13 - ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s How Strong My Love Is             [02:23]\n  14 - IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Been Loving You Too Long            [02:54]\n  15 - Just One More Day                        [03:28]\n  16 - Security                                 [02:33]\n  17 - chained and bound                        [02:40]\n  18 - Ole Man Trouble [Album Cut - Otis Blue]  [02:36]\n  19 - Cigarettes and Coffee [The Soul Album]   [03:59]\n  20 - She Put The Hurt On Me                   [02:37]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 56:33\nTotal Size...........: 265.18 MB\n\n\n[Disc 2]\n\n  01 - Shake [Live]                             [02:55]\n  02 - My Girl                                  [02:53]\n  03 - I Can't Turn You Loose                   [02:43]\n  04 - Mr Pitiful                               [02:41]\n  05 - Respect                                  [02:06]\n  06 - (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction            [02:44]\n  07 - Glory Of Love                            [02:57]\n  08 - I Love You More Than Words Can Say       [02:53]\n  09 - I've Got Dreams To Remember              [03:14]\n  10 - Open The Door                            [02:22]\n  11 - IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Coming Home To See About You         [03:01]\n  12 - Nobody's Fault But Mine                  [02:23]\n  13 - Champagne And Wine                       [02:58]\n  14 - A Lover's Question                       [02:54]\n  15 - Love Man                                 [02:18]\n  16 - Free Me                                  [03:06]\n  17 - Direct Me                                [02:16]\n  18 - Amen                                     [03:05]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 49:39\nTotal Size...........: 270.31 MB\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Redding&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Redding&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRipper.......: EAC V1.0 beta 2, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, FLAC - 8 - oan\n\nCodec........: Free Lossless Audio Codec [FLAC]\n\nVersion......: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\n\nQuality......: Lossless, [avg. compression: 59 %]\n\nChannels.....: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nTags.........: VorbisComment\n\nScand Artwork.........: @ 600dpi\n\nTraders Little Helper....: checksum Files .ffp &amp; .md5\n\nLyrics....: c/o EAC V1.0 beta 2\n\n\nRipped by....: oneanight (oan) on 10/09/2011\n\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on 07/10/2011\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3662e7bb1d888df2018363a449023c963012205","amp;dn":"Otis+Redding+Soul+Legend+2011+%5BEAC+-+FLAC+-+LYRICS%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3662e7bb1d888df2018363a449023c963012205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,102,46,123,177,216,136,223,32,24,54,58,68,144,35,201,99,1,34,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
