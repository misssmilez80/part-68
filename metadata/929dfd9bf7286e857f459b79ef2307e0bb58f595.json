Now laugh at the Republicans. Or better yet, listen to these spellbinding new songs. &quot;You're Getting Sleepy&quot; is 11 originals, recorded in the studio, covering an hypnotic blend of subjects: ultra-conservatives, corporate fat cats, religion in government, the inequities of war, and the new American Spring.\n\n&quot;Vote Republican&quot; is a mesmerizing mockery of GOP nonsense in the run-up to the 2012 election (already a hit on YouTube). &quot;Citizens United&quot; is a sensuous slow-jam sneer at corporate personhood. &quot;The Unions Are to Blame&quot; lampoons the Big Business lunacy that has spurred thousands to Occupy Wall Street. There's a theme song for &quot;The Wedding of Church and State&quot; and the hallelujah blow-out of &quot;I Want a Marriage Like They Had in the Bible.&quot;\n\n01. Vote Republican\n02. I Want a Marriage Like They Had in the Bible\n03. The Unions Are to Blame\n04. To the Victims of This Tragedy We Send Our Thoughts and Prayers\n05. Citizens United\n06. Beer Party Anthem\n07.
