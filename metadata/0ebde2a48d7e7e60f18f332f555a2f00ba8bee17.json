As I imagined, the quality is not the best, but acceptable. I did notice a big difference when doing an actual movie instead of animation. The picture is somewhat &quot;grainy&quot; at times and seems to be &quot;out of focus&quot; as well at times. Overall, I've seem some actual Bluray 3D movies that were worse than this... Clash of the Titans to name specifically, so here it is.\n\nSame as the others, (h264) video with AC3 audio in a MKV container. 1080P half side-by-side format, viewable on most 3D TV's etc. etc.\n\nI will post the next two of the Trilogy shortly.\n\nComment and seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ebde2a48d7e7e60f18f332f555a2f00ba8bee17","amp;dn":"Transformers+Bluray+%28Encoded+Bluray+2D+to+3D+in+SBS+Format%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ebde2a48d7e7e60f18f332f555a2f00ba8bee17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,189,226,164,141,126,126,96,241,143,51,47,85,90,47,0,186,139,238,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
