He prefers a non-violent resolution to fighting where possible, and refuses to use a gun except in the pilot episode when he fires an AK-47 at his enemies. MacGyver works as a troubleshooter for the fictional Phoenix Foundation in Los Angeles. Educated as a scientist with a background as a Bomb Disposal Technician/EOD in Vietnam (&quot;Countdown&quot;), and from a fictional United States government agency, the Department of External Services (DXS), he is used as a resourceful agent able to solve a range of problems along with his ever-present Swiss army knife.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c232af31496e581e1da50e6c59e9a4f31f6f42a4","amp;dn":"MacGyver+++%28The+Complete+Collector%5C%27s+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c232af31496e581e1da50e6c59e9a4f31f6f42a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,50,175,49,73,110,88,30,29,165,14,108,89,233,164,243,31,111,66,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
