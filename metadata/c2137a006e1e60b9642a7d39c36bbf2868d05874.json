What makes this story so exceptional is that they are both in the process of changing their bodies from female to male, at the same time. This film follows their gender journey and the prejudice they encounter along the way - including the humiliation and fear they suffer of having eggs thrown at them as they walk to the bus stop. The documentary tells the story of how Sam and Evan met, fell in love and embarked on a remarkable transgender journey together to transform their bodies from Girls to Men.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2137a006e1e60b9642a7d39c36bbf2868d05874","amp;dn":"Sam+and+Evan%3A+From+Girls+to+Men+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2137a006e1e60b9642a7d39c36bbf2868d05874","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,19,122,0,110,30,96,185,100,42,125,57,195,107,191,40,104,208,88,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
