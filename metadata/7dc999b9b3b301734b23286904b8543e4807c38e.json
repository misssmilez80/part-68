Fueled by vocalist Scott Stapp's Weiland-inspired growl, Creed rode the Seattle pop-suffused string of hits included here to become one of the 90's most successful rock acts--if one whose level of critical revile nearly matched its multi-million sales. This CD/DVD combo features 13 of the band's signature performances (including all eight of its number one singles), songs that often turn on a Christianity-inspired message that could be as opaque (the anthemic &quot;Higher&quot;) as it was overt (&quot;My Own Prison,&quot; &quot;What's This Life For&quot;). \n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Torn                                                 [06:26]\n02.My own prison                                        [05:00]\n03.What's this life for                                 [03:32]\n04.One                                                  [05:02]\n05.Are you ready                                        [04:47]\n06.Higher                                               [05:26]\n07.With arms wide open                                  [04:38]\n08.What if                                              [05:19]\n09.One last breath                                      [03:59]\n10.Don't stop dancing                                   [04:31]\n11.Bullets                                              [03:51]\n12.My sacrifice                                         [04:56]\n13.Weathered                                            [05:30]\n____\n\n62:57 min\n100,7 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
