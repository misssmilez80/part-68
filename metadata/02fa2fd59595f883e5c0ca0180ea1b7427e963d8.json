Railroad Detective \\&quot;Matt Clark\\&quot; -- takes a role in tracking down famous outlaws from the Old West in stories that are at least partly based on the true accounts. In that sense, it\\'s almost an anthology series, and as someone else pointed out, this odd structure poses some timeline conflicts with the real events, but it\\'s a fun series with plenty of action to satisfy a western-hungry 1950\\'s audience -- and it still holds up pretty well 55 years later. Clark cuts a powerful figure in his western gear as he goes up against some of history\\'s baddest baddies. And his girl-sidekick Frankie is quite a dish. If you\\'re a western fan, be sure to check it out if you have a chance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02fa2fd59595f883e5c0ca0180ea1b7427e963d8","amp;dn":"Stories+of+the+Century+-+tv+western+series+1954+-+55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02fa2fd59595f883e5c0ca0180ea1b7427e963d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,250,47,213,149,149,248,131,229,192,202,1,128,234,27,116,39,233,99,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
