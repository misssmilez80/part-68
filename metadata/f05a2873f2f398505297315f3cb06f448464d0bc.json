Some features are also available in OSX 10.7 (Lion).\n\nTotalFinder is a plugin for Finder\n\nTotalFinder is an add-on which gets loaded into the Finder when you launch TotalFinder.app. It does not modify your Finder files on the disk. It modifies the current instance of Finder running in memory. It works similar to SIMBL plugins which you may know from other programs. However, TotalFinder is a standalone application and is not dependent on SIMBL and should work reliably alongside other SIMBL applications.\n\nTabbed Browsing\n\nAdd tabs on top of Finder. The same tabs as seen in Google Chrome.\n\n\nDual Mode\n\n\nDisplay two Finder windows side-by-side in dual mode.\n\n\nFolders on Top\n\n\nDon't make me think. Folders should always go first in list view.\n\n\nShow System Files\n\n\nShow me all files on the disk. I'm not afraid to see the cruft.\n\n\nVisor\n\n\nConvenient system-wide Finder always one key-press away.\n\n\nCut &amp; Paste\n\n\nUse keyboard shortcuts to move files around. Faster than drag &amp; drop.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS x.6 and above (Lion ready)\n\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f05a2873f2f398505297315f3cb06f448464d0bc","amp;dn":"Total+Finder+v.+1.3.1+with+Core+keygen%2Fpatch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f05a2873f2f398505297315f3cb06f448464d0bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,90,40,115,242,243,152,80,82,151,49,95,60,176,111,68,132,100,208,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
