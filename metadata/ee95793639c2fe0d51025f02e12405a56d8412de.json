First released on June 23, 2011, it is the third installment of the live-action Transformers film series. Like its predecessors, Transformers and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is directed by Michael Bay and produced by Steven Spielberg. The film\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s story structure revolves around a genuine NASA manned mission to the Moon. Three years after the events of the second film and 42 years after the Apollo 11 space race, the Autobots continue to work for the NEST (Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers) military force. Meanwhile, the Decepticons unveil a plan to use the new groundbreaking technology, the Pillars, to enslave Humanity in order to save the home planet of the Transformers, Cybertron.\nShia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and John Turturro reprised their starring roles, with Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving returning to voice the characters Optimus Prime and Megatron, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White reprising their roles as the parents of the main protagonist, Sam Witwicky. English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replaced Megan Fox as the lead female character; the cast also saw the additions of Patrick Dempsey, John Malkovich, Ken Jeong, and Frances McDormand. Leonard Nimoy, Keith Szarabajka, Ron Bottitta, John DiMaggio, George Coe, and Francesco Quinn joined the film\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s voice cast. The script was written by Ehren Kruger, who also collaborated on the narrative of the second film of the series. Bay has stated this would be his last installment in the series. Dark of the Moon was shot with both regular 35mm film cameras and specially developed 3-D cameras, with filming locations including Indiana, Washington, D.C., Moscow, Florida, and Chicago. The film was rendered specifically for 3-D, and the visual effects involved more complex robots which took longer to render.\nIn May 2011, it was announced that Paramount Pictures moved Transformers: Dark of the Moon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s release date of July 1, 2011, to June 29, in order to receive an early response to footage. The film was then released nationwide one day earlier, June 28, in selected 3-D and IMAX theaters, to open exclusively one night before its official global release, and one day later in wide release, in both, 2-D and 3-D formats, including IMAX 3D, and featuring Dolby Surround 7.1 sound.\nCritical reception of the film was mixed to negative, with several critics praising the film\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s visuals but criticizing its writing, acting, and length. Dark of the Moon has grossed $1.11 billion worldwide, to become the fourth highest-grossing film of all time, the second highest grossing film of 2011 (behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Part 2), the highest grossing film in the Transformers series, and the tenth film to gross over $1 billion.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee95793639c2fe0d51025f02e12405a56d8412de","amp;dn":"Transformers+3+Dark+of+The+Moon+1080p+by+ABHi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee95793639c2fe0d51025f02e12405a56d8412de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,149,121,54,57,194,254,13,81,2,95,2,225,36,5,165,109,132,18,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
