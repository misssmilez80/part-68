Unfortunetly the label went bankrupt before the album could be sold in the states.  Most American don't even know this album exists!  And what a gem it is.\n\nAs the name suggests, fast paced music with manic energy.  Suffron really outdoes herself.  This is very hard to find in FLAC!  I went out and bought this so download now before it;s gone tomorrow!\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. From Rush Hour With Love\n2. Fading Of The Man\n3. Try Everything\n4. Luxury Cage\n5. Faster Faster\n6. Nothing's Feeling New\n7. Millennium\n8. Pretty Girl Hate\n9. Kung Fu Movies\n10. Pub Pusher\t\t\n\nI also have this in MP3 320k format:\n\nI also have a &quot;best of Saffron&quot; in MP3 format here (Saffron is lead singer)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d26f2489663d094d46f63befb486a6cca92f962","amp;dn":"Republica+%7C+1998+%7C+Speed+Ballads+%7C+%2Arare%2A+%7C+FLAC+%7C+cue%2Blog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d26f2489663d094d46f63befb486a6cca92f962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,38,242,72,150,99,208,148,212,111,99,190,251,72,106,108,202,146,249,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
