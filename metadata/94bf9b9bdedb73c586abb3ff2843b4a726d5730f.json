He attempts to function in a world that, for him, is filled with strange voices, electrical noise, disconcerting images, and jarringly sudden emotional shifts. He clings to his humanity like a raft, barely afloat in a sea of terror. In a brief moment of congruence, he shatters his image reflected in a window, perhaps to more properly align it with his fragmented psyche. During his quest, he runs afoul of the law and an ongoing murder investigation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94bf9b9bdedb73c586abb3ff2843b4a726d5730f","amp;dn":"Clean%2C+Shaven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94bf9b9bdedb73c586abb3ff2843b4a726d5730f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,191,155,155,222,219,115,197,134,171,179,255,40,67,180,167,38,213,115,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
