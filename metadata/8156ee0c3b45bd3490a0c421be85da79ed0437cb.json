The usual DVDFab rip wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work, so I went with the new urex DVD Ripper Platinum. That resulted in the English subtitles being hardcoded. Sorry about that. More importantly, though, is a note about the film. Zola is famous for his expose on the institutionalized anti-Semitism of the French Army regarding the Dreyfus Affair, where an innocent French officer was accused of espionage and treason, and the only reason for suspecting him was that he was Jewish.  What is fascinating is that the movie, which claims to celebrate the life of the human rights champion and anti-censorship Zola, makes absolutely NO MENTION of DreyfusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ status as a Jew. I can only assume that the pervasive anti-Semitism in America in the 1930s is the reason for this stupid irony. \n\nTherefore, I point interested viewers to a documentary that the History Channel made in 1998 about Jews in Hollywood, called HOLLYWOODISM, which I will link to here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4184880/Hollywoodism__Jews__Movies__amp__The_American_Dream&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4184880/Hollywoodism__Jews__Movies__amp__The_American_Dream&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI have also included a number of pictures and scans relating to the History of the times.\n\n\n\n\nThe Life of Emile Zola is a 1937 American biographical film about French author ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°mile Zola. Set in the mid through late 19th century, it depicts his friendship with noted painter Paul CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©zanne, and his rise to fame through his prolific writing, with particular focus on his involvement in the Dreyfus affair. The film had its premiere at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles and was a great success both \ncritically and financially; contemporary reviews cited it as the best biographical film made up to that time. It is still held in high regard by many critics. It is the second biographical film to win the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nIn 2000, The Life of Emile Zola was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.\n\nPlot\n\nStruggling writer ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°mile Zola (Paul Muni) shares a drafty Paris attic with his friend, painter Paul CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©zanne (Vladimir Sokoloff). A chance encounter with a street prostitute (Erin O'Brien-Moore) hiding from a police raid leads to his first bestseller, Nana, an exposÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© of the seamy underside of Parisian life.\n\nOther successful books follow. Zola becomes rich and famous; he marries Alexandrine (Gloria Holden) and settles down to a comfortable life in his mansion. One day, his old friend CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©zanne, still poor and unknown, visits him before leaving the city. He tells Zola that he has become complacent, a far cry from the zealous reformer of his youth.\n\nMeanwhile, a French secret agent steals a letter addressed to a military officer in the German embassy. The letter confirms there is a spy within the top French army staff. With little thought, the army commanders decide that Jewish Captain Alfred Dreyfus (Joseph Schildkraut) is the traitor. He is courtmartialed and imprisoned on Devil's Island in French Guyana.\n\nLater, Colonel Picquart (Henry O'Neill), the new chief of intelligence, discovers evidence implicating Major Walsin-Esterhazy (Robert Barrat) as the spy, but he is ordered by his superiors to remain silent, as this revelation would embarrass them. He is quickly reassigned to a distant post.\n\nYears go by. Finally, Dreyfus's loyal wife Lucie (Gale Sondergaard) pleads with Zola to take up her husband's cause. Zola is reluctant to give up his comfortable life, but the evidence she has brought him piques his curiosity. He publishes a letter in the newspaper accusing the army of covering up a monstrous injustice. Zola barely escapes from an angry mob incited by agents provocateurs employed by the military.\n\nAs he had expected, he is brought to trial for libel. His attorney, Maitre Labori (Donald Crisp) does his best, but the presiding judge refuses to allow him to bring up the Dreyfus affair and the military witnesses all commit perjury, with the exception of Picquart. Zola is found guilty and sentenced to a year in prison. He reluctantly accepts the advice of his friends and flees to England, where he continues to write on behalf of Dreyfus.\n\nA new administration finally admits that Dreyfus is innocent, those responsible for the coverup are forced to resign or are dismissed, and Walsin-Esterhazy flees the country. However, Zola dies of carbon monoxide poisoning due to a faulty stove the night before the public ceremony in which Dreyfus is exonerated.\n\nCast\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tPaul Muni as ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°mile Zola\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tGloria Holden as Alexandrine Zola\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tGale Sondergaard as Lucie Dreyfus\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tJoseph Schildkraut as Captain Alfred Dreyfus\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tDonald Crisp as Maitre Labori\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tErin O'Brien-Moore as Nana\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tJohn Litel as Charpentier\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tHenry O'Neill as Colonel Picquart\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tMorris Carnovsky as Anatole France, Zola's friend and supporter\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tLouis Calhern as Major Dort\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tRalph Morgan as Commander of Paris\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tRobert Barrat as Major Walsin-Esterhazy\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tVladimir Sokoloff as Paul CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©zanne\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tGrant Mitchell as Georges Clemenceau\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tHarry Davenport as Chief of Staff\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tRobert Warwick as Major Henry\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tCharles Richman as M.
