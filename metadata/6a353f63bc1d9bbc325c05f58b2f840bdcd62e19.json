These concealed targets may be explosive devices or weapons, which can be buried in the ground, concealed in building structures, hidden under clothing, or inside luggage. Concealed targets may also be people who are stowaways or victims of an avalanche or earthquake.\n\nAlthough much information is available in conference proceedings and professional society publications, this book brings all the relevant information in a single, expertly written and organized volume.\n\nReaders gain an understanding of the physics underlying electromagnetic (EM) detection methods, as well as the factors that affect the performance of EM detection equipment, helping them choose the right type of equipment and techniques to meet the demands of particular tasks. Among the topics covered are:\n\n    *\n\n      Ultra-wideband radar and ground-penetrating radar\n    *\n\n      Millimeter, sub-millimeter, and terahertz systems\n    *\n\n      Radar systems including Doppler, harmonic, impulse, FMCW, and holographic\n    *\n\n      Radiometric systems\n    *\n\n      Nuclear quadrupole resonance systems\n\nAuthor David Daniels has many years of experience designing and deploying EM systems to detect concealed targets. As a result, this publication is essential for scientists and engineers who are developing or using EM equipment and techniques for a diverse range of purposes, including homeland security, crime prevention, or the detection of persons.\nAbout the Author\nDavid J. Daniels, BSc, MSc, CEng, FIET, SMIEE, is the Chief Consultant for Sensors at Cobham Technical Services (formerly known as ERA Technology). David has more than thirty years of experience in the development of radar, acoustic, and electromagnetic systems as well as products for security, sensing, and test applications for the military and commercial enterprises. He has brought such products to market as acoustic detection systems, fiber optic cryogenic liquid leak sensors, marine radar rescue transponders, ultra-wideband microwave amplifiers, ground-penetrating radar, land-mine detectors, and RF and microwave security systems. His current interests center on sensor systems for land-mine detection, homeland security, and military counterterrorist activities.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 284 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley-IEEE Press; 1 edition (December 14, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470121696\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470121696\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a353f63bc1d9bbc325c05f58b2f840bdcd62e19","amp;dn":"EM+Detection+of+Concealed+Targets%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a353f63bc1d9bbc325c05f58b2f840bdcd62e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,53,63,99,188,29,155,188,50,92,5,245,139,47,132,11,220,214,46,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
