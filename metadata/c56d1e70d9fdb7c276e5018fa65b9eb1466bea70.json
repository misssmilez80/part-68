Wahlgren was born in Gothenburg, Sweden, to a Swedish mother and a Ghanaian father. His father left the family when he was a small child. Papa Dees most commercially successful track is his version of the Cat Stevens song The First Cut Is the Deepest.\n\n- - -\n\nWahlgren debuted in 1988 with the single Funky Raggamuffin/Let the Music Play, a mixture of dancehall and hip hop. He then joined the Stonefunkers and became the group's rapper. This was followed by a few years of cooperation with Rob'n'Raz. Wahlgren then went solo, and had his breakthrough in 1990 with the album Lettin' Off Steam, which was predominantly hip hop and dancehall. His next album, One Step Ahead, had elements of soul and reggae, mixing song and rap. His 1994 release, Original Master, produced by Denniz Pop at Cheiron Studio, incorporated eurodisco into his music.\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s he released several albums, often in cooperation with Desmond Foster and a couple with Soundism. 2001, Soundism also produced the Papa Dee song Hottie Hottie Girls, featuring Lady Saw, Jamaica's prime female dancehall star . He is also a member of The Brooklyn Funk Essentials and recorded Walking Down Memory Gap Lane with David Barratt as Dubchek.
