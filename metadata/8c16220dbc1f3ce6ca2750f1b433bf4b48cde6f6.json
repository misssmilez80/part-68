A Jedi who left Coruscant to defeat Mandalorians ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and returned a disciple of the dark side, bent on destroying the Republic. The Jedi Council gave Revan his life back, but the price of redemption was high. His memories have been erased. All thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s left are nightmaresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and deep, abiding fear.\n \nWhat exactly happened beyond the Outer Rim? Revan canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite remember, yet canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t entirely forget. Somehow he stumbled across a terrible secret that threatens the very existence of the Republic. With no idea what it is, or how to stop it, Revan may very well fail, for heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never faced a more powerful and diabolic enemy. But only death can stop him from trying.\n\nEbook included\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c16220dbc1f3ce6ca2750f1b433bf4b48cde6f6","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+The+Old+Republic+Revan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c16220dbc1f3ce6ca2750f1b433bf4b48cde6f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,22,34,13,188,31,60,230,202,39,80,241,180,51,191,75,72,205,230,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
