Knowing that he has mere minutes until his ship's hull is breached, he purposely crash lands on the nearest planet in hopes of temporarily dazing the creature.\n\nHe is reminded by his superior officer before entering the atmosphere that the law must be upheld at any cost. If contact is made with any pre-stellar lifeforms, those lifeforms must be terminated. No exceptions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84bd52775f3139d24937ecb548beb158679ecf8d","amp;dn":"Antebios","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84bd52775f3139d24937ecb548beb158679ecf8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,189,82,119,95,49,57,210,73,55,236,181,72,190,177,88,103,158,207,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
