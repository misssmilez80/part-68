She also has backing her from REK's Band; Glenn Fukunaga on upright bass, Tom Van Schalk on drums, Marty Muse on pedal steel and lap steel guitars as well as Mr. Brotherton on acoustic and electric guitars, harmony vocals, National guitar, bass, mandolin, lap steel, and mandola; from her band Sean Feder on Dobro, banjo and percussion and Andy Lentz on fiddle. As to be expected from a Rich Brotherton produced disc the playing is tight and not only doesn't step on the vocals but supports the vocals and the song. Rita Hosking isn't a household name yet and that in itself is a wonder, her voice has the richness and that delicate balance of strength and fragility that gives a song its true expression. In all honesty Burn is a disc that should be heard by all and it will remedy that.\n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/01/21/rita-hosking/[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30189abd9e8b534c1bbc60f2d47b94584666369f","amp;dn":"Rita+Hosking...Burn%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30189abd9e8b534c1bbc60f2d47b94584666369f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,24,154,189,158,139,83,76,27,188,96,242,212,123,148,88,70,102,54,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
