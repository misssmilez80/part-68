While a fundamentally uneven 13 songs, this departure from the processed norm finds the musicians channeling their inner groove through soulful rhythms and riffs.  Starting with a track modeled after the primal garage blues stomp of the Black Keys, the album switches styles from there on out. Mute Math sound most natural when they let loose as a funk rock/alt-rock hybrid. This form of music totally works for them and pops up in more than a few of their best songs, including Cavalries, One More, and Walking Paranoia.\n\nReleased: October 4, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~1,000 kbps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
