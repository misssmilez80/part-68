The cost of \nbenefit, he said, had gone up by nearly 60 billion pounds \nin the last decade. Critics say that the welfare state is in \ncrisis.And yet at the same time, there's resounding support \namong the British public for welfare. In an Ipsos MORI poll \ncommissioned for this programme, 92 per cent of adults \nagreed with the statement that it is important to have a \nbenefits system to provide a safety net for anyone that \nneeds it.John Humphrys travels the country to talk to the \npeople with the most to lose: people on incapacity benefit; \nthe long-term unemployed; people on housing benefit; \nlone parents. Are they prepared for the harsher future \nahead? He returns to the area where he was born - \nSplott in Cardiff - to show how attitudes to work and \nwelfare have changed in his lifetime. When he was \ngrowing up, a man who didn't work was regarded as a \npariah; today, one in four of the working-age population in \nSplott is on some form of benefit. John also visits America,\nwhere 15 years ago they embarked on what has been \ncalled a 'welfare revolution'. Is this more punitive model \nwhere the UK heading? He looks at specific reforms the \nGovernment has in mind or has begun already.\nHumphrys concludes that the public don't like what they \nsee as a growing sense of entitlement among some \ngroups claiming benefits, and politicians respond to the \npublic mood. He argues that there is strong consensus \nacross political divides, and that reform would edge the \nUK back towards the original Beveridge vision of welfare.\n\nURL Link : \n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n:::                             Other Notes                             :::\n:::                             -----------                             :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n:::                             Group Notes                             :::\n:::                             -----------                             :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::             We are not currently looking for any new sites          :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::                               Greets                                :::\n:::                               ------                                :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::                                                                     :::\n:::               (All The Uk Groups That Do There Share)               :::\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nNFO Creator v.1 Coded by Us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8625247c7fd4e7b041df63c83554f9cedda116b5","amp;dn":"The.Future.State.Of.Welfare.With.John.Humphrys.720p.HDTV.x264-FT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8625247c7fd4e7b041df63c83554f9cedda116b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,37,36,124,127,212,231,176,65,223,99,200,53,84,249,206,221,161,22,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
