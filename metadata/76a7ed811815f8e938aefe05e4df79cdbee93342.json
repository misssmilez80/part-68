Before long      \n    they re-team and end up embarking on a crime spree, that despite         \n    their ineptitude, turns them into notorious outlaws and puts them in     \n    the path of many colorful and dangerous characters.                      \n                                                                             \n    Very much a product of it's time (the early 70's), with it's             \n    rambling, character-driven narrative, it's a bit loose and episodic      \n    during it's first half.
