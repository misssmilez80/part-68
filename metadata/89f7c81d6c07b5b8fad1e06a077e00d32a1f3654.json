Lost At Sea 2:57 [Notes]\nNever Shout Never has been\nreborn. While the moniker has\nlong referred to\n20-year-old Christofer Drew, it is\nnow the name of a full band\nwith the\nmessy-haired singer-songwriter\nat its helm - and the change\ncouldn't have\ncome at a better time\nWith six EPs and two albums\nunder his belt, over 2.5 million\nFacebook fans\nnearly 50 million MySpace profile\nviews and over 157 million song\nplays\nit's clear that Drew has achieved\nbreakthrough success since his\nfirst\nupload. However, the talented\nguitarist experienced some dark\nmoments\nfollowing the release of his Butch\nVig-produced album, Harmony,\nbecoming &quot;a\nlittle bitter towards the music\nindustry&quot; and left shaken by the\nbreakup\nfrom his girlfriend of almost two\nyears. But, through his search for\na\nhigher consciousness, he found a\npath of enlightenment that led\nto a whole\nnew outlook on music and life\nIn an almost therapeutic way,\nDrew has woven his experiences\ninto Time\nTravel, the first album recorded\nand produced by Never Shout\nNever, which\nnow includes Drew, Caleb\nDenison (guitar/drums/\npercussion), Taylor MacFee\n(bass) and Hayden Kaiser (guitar,\npercussion). The band members,\nwho each\ncontributed backing vocals on\nthe full-length, holed up in\nSpringfield, MO\njust one hour outside of their\nhometown of Joplin, and\ndedicated themselves\nto making Never Shout Never's\nmost impressive album to date","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89f7c81d6c07b5b8fad1e06a077e00d32a1f3654","amp;dn":"Never+Shout+Never+-+Time+Travel+%5BMP3-VBR-2011%5D+-MTD+%5BPR%21M3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89f7c81d6c07b5b8fad1e06a077e00d32a1f3654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,247,200,29,108,7,181,184,250,209,224,106,7,126,0,211,42,31,54,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
