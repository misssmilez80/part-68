Roomful of Blues, a popular five-horn nonet, has rarely sounded more exciting than on this musical meeting with the legendary singer/altoist. Vinson himself is exuberant on some of the selections, particularly &quot;House of Joy,&quot; one of five instrumentals among the eight selections. Whether one calls it blues, bebop, or early R&amp;B, this accessible music is very enjoyable and deserves to be more widely heard.  Scott Yanow, All Music Guide\n\nTracklist\n1.
