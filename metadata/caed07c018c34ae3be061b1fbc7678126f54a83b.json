Almost\n        singlehandedly,  against  overwhelming  odds  and  with little\n        regard for her own well-being, Margaret reunited thousands  of\n        families,  brought  authorities   to  account  and   worldwide\n        attention  to  an extraordinary  miscarriage  of justice.  She\n        discovered  a  secret  that the  British  government  had kept\n        hidden for years: one hundred and thirty thousand children  in\n        care had  been sent  abroad to  commonwealth countries, mainly\n        Australia. Children as young as four had been told that  their\n        parents were dead,  and been sent  to children's homes  on the\n        other  side of  the world.  Many were  subjected to  appalling\n        abuse. They were promised oranges and sunshine, they got  hard\n        labour and life in institutions. \n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                 Hugo Weaving        ....
