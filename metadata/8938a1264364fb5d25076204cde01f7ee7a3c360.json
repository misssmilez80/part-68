The Basic Building Blocks of Matter\nIn the past century, physicists have discovered new constituents of matter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ quarks, gluons, neutrinos, and many others. These basic building blocks have been linked together into a well tested theoretical framework, the Standard Model of particle physics. But there are hints that the Standard Model is incomplete, and that a deeper theory lies behind it, waiting to be teased into the open. The work of scientists Bonnie Fleming and Mark Kruse, both at Fermilab in Batavia, IL is profiled.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8938a1264364fb5d25076204cde01f7ee7a3c360","amp;dn":"learner.org-+Physics+for+the+21st+century-+Unit1-1.+The+Basic+Bu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8938a1264364fb5d25076204cde01f7ee7a3c360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,56,161,38,67,100,251,93,37,7,98,4,205,224,31,126,231,163,195,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
