Covering diverse topics from these disciplines, all of which are needed to understand how galaxies form and evolve, this book is ideal for researchers entering the field. Individual chapters explore the evolution of the Universe as a whole and its particle and radiation content; linear and nonlinear growth of cosmic structure; processes affecting the gaseous and dark matter components of galaxies and their stellar populations; the formation of spiral and elliptical galaxies; central supermassive black holes and the activity associated with them; galaxy interactions; and the intergalactic medium. Emphasizing both observational and theoretical aspects, this book provides a coherent introduction for astronomers, cosmologists, and astroparticle physicists to the broad range of science underlying the formation and evolution of galaxies.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 840 pages\n    * Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (June 28, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0521857937\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0521857932","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d4bda9f63a6070425a9d1d48a07978e684de318","amp;dn":"Galaxy+Formation+and+Evolution+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d4bda9f63a6070425a9d1d48a07978e684de318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,75,218,159,99,166,7,4,37,169,209,212,138,7,151,142,104,77,227,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
