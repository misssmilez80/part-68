The information I needed was gathered by reverse engineering and trial &amp; error. \nNow for me itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s working and I want to share this program with other iPhone TomTom users. I tested it on my jailbroken iPhone 4s with latest firmware. My PC is running Win XP.\nI canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell you if it is working for you because I only tested it on my phone.\n\nWay of working:\n- Create a POI database on your PC (I use Mapsource for that because I have Garmin navigation)\n- Create from this POI database an OV2 file. I use program POI editor for that.\n- Use my program to generate file Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmapsettings.cfgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Here are the TomTom favorites stored.\n- Replace file Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmapsettings.cfgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in your TomTom app on your iPhone. I use program DiskAid for that.\n\nThe location of file Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmapsettings.cfgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in your iPhone is: Apps &gt; Europe &gt; Documents &gt; Western_and_Central_Europe \nProbably it's also working for the US map but I could not test it.\n\nTip: make a backup of your original mapsettings.cfg file so you always can restore to the original situation.\n\nRemark: if you are not familiar with the way of working as described above please make a study on the internet or forget it.\n\nFor sure there are bugs (I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know bug-free programs). Use it at your own risk. Please give some feedback if it is working for your iPhone.\n\n\nVersion 0.1: Fix a bug to be able to route to a favorite that was created with TomTomCfgCreator.exe\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:642639a5738a9502cc5b34b04320d2635afe6cb7","amp;dn":"TomTom+Favorite+Creator+iPhone.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"642639a5738a9502cc5b34b04320d2635afe6cb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,38,57,165,115,138,149,2,204,91,52,176,67,32,210,99,90,254,108,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
