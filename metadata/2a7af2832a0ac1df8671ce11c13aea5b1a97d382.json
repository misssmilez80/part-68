Executed by hanging, he seemingly returns as a ghost to terrorize and wreak vengeance on the guilty town that murdered him.\n\nRimfire is loaded with great character actors, including James Millican, Reed Hadley, Jason Robards Sr., and Fuzzy Knight, alongside two previous Universal monsters, The Werewolf Of London's Henry Hull and Glen Strange, the last of the classic Frankenstein monsters!\n\nAlthough it's running time could (and should) have been stretched a little for greater suspense, this is still an entertaining, if compact, western whodunit with lots of great scenes.\n\nIt can also be viewed as sort of a forerunner (along with Django Il Bastardo) to Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter. In fact, the three would make a great triple feature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a7af2832a0ac1df8671ce11c13aea5b1a97d382","amp;dn":"Rimfire+%7BWestern%7D+%5B1949%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a7af2832a0ac1df8671ce11c13aea5b1a97d382","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,122,242,131,42,10,193,223,134,113,206,17,193,58,234,91,26,151,211,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
