The book contains over 80 true stories from 60 countries \nexploring people's ability to resist injustice and change the \nworld around them. The preface is written by Vaclav Havel, \nformer President of the Czech Republic.\n\nBig changes often start with acts that looked pointless at the \ntime: small acts of resistance, bold acts of defiance, subtle \nacts of subversion, even witty acts of disobedience. The small \nacts range from famous struggles such as those against Nazism \nand Communism and for Civil Rights to ones that have been \nignored by the media or are still continuing.\n\nThe protagonists range from a few icons to, mainly, people who \nhave been unjustly forgotten or have remained anonymous. Telling \nthe stories of more than eighty acts of resistance, spanning the \nworld and the 20th and 21st centuries, this book pays homage to \nthe groups and individuals that treat the impossible as the \npossible that just hasnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t happened yet. Small Acts of Resistance \ncelebrates the awe-inspiring ingenuity and courage of the human \nspirit and pays tribute to those who have been standing up to say &quot;no&quot;.
