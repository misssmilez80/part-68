Over time, they forgot about the Sword of Hermes and the black rocks, but the desire still burned deep within NeferÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart.\n\nNow, Nefer has recovered the sword and is using its power to destroy the seal protecting the Nethergate. He wishes to release RahkdanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s followers so that they may once again unleash fury upon the world.\n\nFortunately, the Ninth Continent, where the Gate stands, is protected by legions of elves and powerful magicians. Nevertheless, even our strongest warriors may still not be able to halt NeferÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s onslaughtÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nIt is up to you to prove your worth as a hero. You must hasten to the Ninth Continent and halt NeferÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advance, before it is too late.\n\nOfficial Source\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://c9.webzen.com/main/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://c9.webzen.com/main/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nUploader Note: I uploaded this because client download on the official site sometimes fail or is unavailable for others, I sure do hope this will help.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80c2aee09a66389b9073114e7b8e0be8062acf21","amp;dn":"Continent+of+the+Ninth+OBT+Client","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80c2aee09a66389b9073114e7b8e0be8062acf21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,194,174,224,154,102,56,155,144,115,17,78,123,142,11,232,6,42,207,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
