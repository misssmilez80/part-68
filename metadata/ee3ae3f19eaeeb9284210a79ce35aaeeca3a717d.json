It's Donnie's birthday and all the geeks from French club have gathered for their annual reunion. Brett (Jonas Brandon) is in from New York, where he dips regularly into the pool of available one-night stand women - despite the torch he carries for Gayle (Lindsey Hancock), who's marrying Travis. Meanwhile, there's boyfriend drama for Russell (Riddlehoover), who holds a torch for Brett! With a casual conversational tone likened to &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters,&quot; Riddlehoover sucks you into this deceptively cheerful film.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee3ae3f19eaeeb9284210a79ce35aaeeca3a717d","amp;dn":"BOOKENDS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee3ae3f19eaeeb9284210a79ce35aaeeca3a717d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,58,227,241,158,174,235,146,132,33,10,121,206,53,170,238,202,58,113,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
