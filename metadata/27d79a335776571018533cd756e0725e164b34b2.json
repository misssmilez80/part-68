Black Bottom refers to a dance which became popular in the 1920s, during the period known as the \\&quot;Flapper era\\&quot;. Flapper in the 1920s was a term applied to a \\&quot;new breed\\&quot; of young Western women who wore short skirts, bobbed their hair, listened to jazz, and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking, treating sex in a casual manner, smoking, driving automobiles and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms.She was also noted as an accomplished tap dancer. Ray Henderson wrote the extant version of \\&quot;Black Bottom\\&quot; for Ann - she had already been performing the popular version of the dance for some time. Some years prior to this, she had also topped the bill on Broadway in her performance of the musically similar \\&quot;Charleston\\&quot;.Pennington also achieved fame as a star of both silent and sound motion pictures.\n                June Clyde (1909 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1987) was an American actress, singer and dancer. She made her first screen appearance at age ten with Hobart Bosworth in \\&quot;The Sea Wolf\\&quot;. Later her voice changed and she joined a stock company . She progressed to a modest career in Hollywood films before marrying film director Thornton Freeland. Clyde moved to England with her husband and appeared in several British films and stage productions starting in 1934, as well as returning to the United States periodically for both stage and film work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27d79a335776571018533cd756e0725e164b34b2","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27d79a335776571018533cd756e0725e164b34b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,215,154,51,87,118,87,16,24,83,60,215,86,224,114,94,22,75,52,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
