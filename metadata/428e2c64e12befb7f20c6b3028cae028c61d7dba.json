When teenage Cossack Dimitri Pechkov sees murderous henchman Bouvarine gun down his Evenk acquaintance, he soon makes it his mission to ensure that no further harm comes to the peaceful tribe. \nDespite the fact that Dimitri has never ventured beyond the borders of the small village in which he was born, his drive to earn the respect of his distant father prompts the brave youngster to rechristen his fallen friend\\'s horse Serko and bring the matter to the czar\\'s attention. Over the course of the next 193 days, Dimitri finds his noble quest growing increasingly arduous as the fearful governor sets out to insure that his message never reaches the powerful monarch. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide / AllMovieBlog\n\nIn 1889, riding a small horse named Gray Serko , Dimitri leaves his garrison of Asian borders of the Russian Empire on the banks of the River Amur .
