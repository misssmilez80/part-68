These are ripped clean to 48 kbps mp3 directly from the DVDs.\n\nSince each episode of Aaron Sorkin TV is like a little play, the sound is actually the best part of his shows; the brilliant dialog. I like to listen to these on my mp3 player, and since the original torrent is still alive four years late, I guess many of you do, too. I hope you enjoy them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96b2e683da089e94f1f13584e3501d924170815b","amp;dn":"The+West+Wing+Audio+Rips+%28from+DVDs%29+%5B48+kbps+mp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96b2e683da089e94f1f13584e3501d924170815b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,178,230,131,218,8,158,148,241,241,53,132,227,80,29,146,65,112,129,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
