This particular CD features the great pianist with his quartet (bassist Dave Young, drummer Martin Drew and guest guitarist Joe Pass) along with trumpeter Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison and altoist Eddie &quot;Cleanhead&quot; Vinson. The strictly instrumental set has many fine solos on appealing tunes such as &quot;Stuffy,&quot; &quot;Broadway&quot; and the lengthy blues &quot;Slooow Drag.&quot; This boppish session gave Vinson a rare chance to really stretch out and he was up for the challenge. ~ Scott Yanow\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
