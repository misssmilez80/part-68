But It Won't be a BATRip.\n\n..I feed in Initial mode so I'm depending on Peers to Help each other. I've got My computer programmed to where once I feed 125%, or if I've been on S2L for 6 hrs. It not only stops seeding, but also Exits Bittorrent. That's the longest I trust staying online B4 I shut down to Upgrade and make sure My Shields are maxxed out.\n\n..Well I guess it does give everybody a chance to finish downloading and disappear all at the same time..LOL..\n\n..I also forgot,(No Memory),that I'll also be Feeding The invisible Ray (1936), but I haven't decided B4 or after The Inv. Woman.\n\n..Quality and Codecs; It's a BATRip. IMDB, Screenshots, etc. are All on KAT. Been having a lot of Problems uploading Here, and My hands are too Damm Crippled to keep re-typing.\n\n..Hope You Njoy This One. Carradine is definately at his Best...xoxoBATxoxo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d6b0a20b82c774cc5fa4dc9951ca6f3dac34987","amp;dn":"The+Invisible+Man%5C%27s+Revenge+%281944%29+a+BATRip+Torrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d6b0a20b82c774cc5fa4dc9951ca6f3dac34987","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,107,10,32,184,44,119,76,197,250,77,201,149,28,166,243,218,195,73,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
