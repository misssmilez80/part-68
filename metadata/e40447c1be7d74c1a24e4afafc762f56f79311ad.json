THANK YOU - Team Kardinal\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nSlackware 13.37 brings many updates and enhancements, among which \nyou'll find two of the most advanced desktop environments available \ntoday: Xfce 4.6.2, a fast and lightweight but visually appealing and \neasy to use desktop environment, and KDE 4.5.5, a recent stable release \nof the 4.5.x series of the award-winning KDE desktop environment.  \nWe continue to make use of HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and udev, \nwhich allow the system administrator to grant use of various hardware \ndevices according to users' group membership so that they will be able \nto use items such as USB flash sticks, USB cameras that appear like USB \nstorage, portable hard drives, CD and DVD media, MP3 players, and more, \nall without requiring sudo, the mount or umount command.  Just plug and \nplay.  Properly set up, Slackware's desktop should be suitable for any \nlevel of Linux experience.  New to the desktop framework are ConsoleKit \nand PolicyKit.  ConsoleKit handles &quot;seats&quot;, things like dealing with \ndevices when switching from one user to another.  PolicyKit is a system \nfor fine-grained access control, allowing a non-root user to run certain \ntasks with elevated privilege, but more securely than if the entire task \nwere simply run as root.\n\n    Slackware uses the 2.6.37.6 kernel bringing you advanced performance \nfeatures such as journaling filesystems, SCSI and ATA RAID volume \nsupport, SATA support, Software RAID, LVM (the Logical Volume Manager), \nand encrypted filesystems.  Kernel support for X DRI (the Direct \nRendering Interface) brings high-speed hardware accelerated 3D graphics \nto Linux.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e40447c1be7d74c1a24e4afafc762f56f79311ad","amp;dn":"Slackware+13.37+Installation+DVD+-+GNU%2FLinux+O%2FS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e40447c1be7d74c1a24e4afafc762f56f79311ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,4,71,193,190,125,116,193,162,78,74,250,252,118,47,86,247,147,17,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
