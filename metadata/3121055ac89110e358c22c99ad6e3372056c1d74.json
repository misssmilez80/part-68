But Senapathi stops her by assuring her that he will soon tie the knot with her. Soon after India gains independence, in 1947, Senapathi weds Amiratham. She gives birth to a boy, Chandrabose, and a girl, Kasturi.\n  Years pass. Chandrabose leaves home, since Senapathi refuses to pay a bribe for a job for Chandrabose. Within a few months, Kasturi receives burns in an accidental fire and dies because Senapathi will not pay the doctor a bribe.\n  The ferocious rebel in Senapathi resurges after Kasturi\\'s death. He kills Inspector Vao, Corporation Commissioner, and warns the public that a similar end awaits others if they demand bribes.\n  Meanwhile, Chandrabose bribes the Road Transport Office officials and becomes an R.T.O. inspector. One day, he accepts a 5000-Rupee bribe for issuing a false certificate to a vehicle owner. Unfortunately, the vehicle causes an accident, killing 40 school children.\n  When Senapathi learns of his son\\'s involvement in the accident, will he spare his own son\\'s life, or continue his mission against corruption and become a national role model, a true Indian?\n\nSee www.imdb.com/title/tt0116630/reviews .\n\nDigitally remastered\nXvid 609x320 24 fps\nAC3 5.1 384kbps\nOriginal Tamil language (or dubbed Hindi or Telugu) - see sample clip.\nNO SUBTITLES - disregard \\&quot;SUBS\\&quot;\nImproved (separate) English subtitles should be available soon.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3121055ac89110e358c22c99ad6e3372056c1d74","amp;dn":"HINDUSTANI+%7E1996%7E+DVDRip++3CD+Xvid+AC3+Subs++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3121055ac89110e358c22c99ad6e3372056c1d74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,33,5,90,200,145,16,227,88,194,44,153,173,110,51,114,5,108,29,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
