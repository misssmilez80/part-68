It is the first production venture of HMI Pictures and second for director SP Hosimin after his first film February 14. The tag line of the film is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA mafia epic overshadowed by love.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The shooting of 'Aayiram Vilakku' started in October, 2009.Set in the back drop of Madurai soil the film is a different kind of gangster story. Its about a strong rowdy Lingam who is ruthless in his acts. While being an untamable wild bull, Lingam comes across a young boy Gopal who is the son of a coolie. Love and bonding develops between the two and LingamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life changes. Lingam who has not known what love and affection is all about starts experiencing the same by the actions of Gopal. Gopal works to bring Lingam out of his life in darkness. Lingam feels Gopal is like a thousand lamps that has lit his dark life hi lived all along. While they are living like a father-son, suddenly some events turn around their lives.\nSathyaraj plays Lingam and Shantanu plays Gopal in this emotional drama. Sathyaraj has played consequential role after a long time. For Shantanu this is going to be a real commercial identification he has been waiting for. His character is diagonally opposite to what he played in Sakkarakatti.\nAnother revelation in the film is going to be Sana Khan according to all. Director Hosimin, Sathyaraj and Shantanu had unanimously praised Sana Khan for her performance in the film. Sana Khan who entered Kollywood as an item girl has proved she is a genuine star material in the film. The most appreciative remarks from all were her ability to perform so well in spite of not able to speak Tamil. So she will be one to watch out in the film.\nThe big stars in Aayiram Viklakku are Sathyaraj, Santhanu Bhagyaraj, Sana Khan, Suman, Delhi Ganesh, Thalaivasal Vijay and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GanjaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Karuppu. Theepeti Ganesh and Suja are also there.\nThe audio of the film was launched on August 9. Srikanth Deva has scored the music for the songs written by Vairamuthu. The film has seven songs and they are these. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMadura MaduraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sung by Naveen &amp; Velmurugan, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPoraleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sung by Karthik, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAndipattiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sung by Karthik, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJigarthandaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sung by Karthik and Rita, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEnna ThavamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sung by KJ Yesudas, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUthama PuthiraneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sung by KJ Yesudas and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRathiyeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sung by Harish Radavendra and Chinmayi\nAll the songs are to be watched for the beautiful words. Particularly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Enna thavam SeithenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sung by KJ Yesudas. Also there is on song that encapsulates the symbols of Madurai like matu thavani, Jigarthanda, Azhagarmalai etc.\nDirector Hosimin belongs to Madurai and so he has shown Madurai in all its flesh and blood. He was an assistant to Shankar. And that adds to his credibility. This film is sure to take Hosimin out of the closet while his first film February 14 with Bharath did not\nHosimin recently said that this film was supposed to be produced by two of the most reputed banners in Tamil films, but destiny had it be produced by a first timer HMI Pictures. This sums up what the film has in store.\n\nCredits :\n\nSource : TR\n\nRipper : C.Ronaldo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreens/Covers:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/95012407708106588210.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/95012407708106588210.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/09490331854532141262.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/09490331854532141262.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/89493034401476489679.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/89493034401476489679.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/64492544699095307540.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/64492544699095307540.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n****check out my other releases****\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/tdkdemon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/tdkdemon/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n****************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;SUPERFAST RELEASES BROUGHT TO YOU BY&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n          \n\n\n                                  Masti Torrents Releasers [ MTR ]\n\n\n\n\n\n            8888b.  888888 8b    d8  dP&quot;Yb  88b 88     88888 8b    d8 888888 88&quot;&quot;Yb 88888 \n             8I  Yb 88__   88b  d88 dP   Yb 88Yb88     88    88b  d88   88   88__dP    88 \n             8I  dY 88&quot;&quot;   88YbdP88 Yb   dP 88 Y88     88    88YbdP88   88   88&quot;Yb     88 \n            8888Y&quot;  888888 88 YY 88  YbodP  88  Y8     88888 88 YY 88   88   88  Yb 88888 \n\n\n\n\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n****************************************************************************************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c0e9d8740ccd0ca8f71874c3195e540638c75ba","amp;dn":"Aayiram+Vilaku+%28Tamil+2011%29+TC+Rip+x264+TDM+-%3DMTR%3D-%40mastitorrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c0e9d8740ccd0ca8f71874c3195e540638c75ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,14,157,135,64,204,208,202,143,113,135,76,49,149,229,64,99,140,117,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
