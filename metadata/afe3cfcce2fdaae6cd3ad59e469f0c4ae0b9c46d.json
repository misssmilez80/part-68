Meeting the need for a comprehensive treatment of the aluminum recycling process, Aluminum Recycling explores the technology and processing strategies required to convert scrap aluminum and its alloys into new aluminum products and mixtures.\n\nThe book details the collecting, sorting, and separating of scrap aluminum as well as the processing and upgrading equipment used. It first describes the aluminum alloys that are contained in the ore body and the various &quot;mines&quot; where aluminum scrap is found, followed by a discussion of the procedures for separating scrap aluminum from other materials. Subsequent chapters review the furnaces used for remelting the recovered scrap and the refining techniques that improve its purity and quality. The book also discusses the economics of scrap recycling and outlines the structure of the recycling industry. The final chapter addresses the unique environmental and safety challenges that recycling operations face.\n\nAlthough the benefits of recycling are numerous, aluminum recycling presents a series of unique challenges. Aluminum Recycling expertly leads you through the sequences of scrap aluminum recycling to provide a solid foundation for overcoming these obstacles.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 248 pages\n    * Publisher: CRC Press (November 1, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 084939662X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0849396625","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afe3cfcce2fdaae6cd3ad59e469f0c4ae0b9c46d","amp;dn":"Aluminum+Recycling%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afe3cfcce2fdaae6cd3ad59e469f0c4ae0b9c46d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,227,207,204,226,253,170,230,205,58,213,158,70,159,12,74,224,185,196,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
