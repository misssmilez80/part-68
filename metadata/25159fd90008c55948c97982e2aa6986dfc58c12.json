Davies. When Kate suddenly finds herself journeying through the real Abadazad in search of her beloved younger brother, MattÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who vanished five years earlierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½she discovers that the truth of Abadazad is far stranger, and more amazing, than fiction. She is guided to enter Abadazad by Little Martha, the protagonist of the novels which she had read, and is given cause to confront the villain known as Lanky Man, to whom is ascribed the disappearance of Matt.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25159fd90008c55948c97982e2aa6986dfc58c12","amp;dn":"Abadazad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25159fd90008c55948c97982e2aa6986dfc58c12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,21,159,217,0,8,197,89,72,201,121,130,226,170,105,134,223,197,140,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
