The creative alchemy was immediate, as 15 epochal tracks (&quot;Dreams,&quot; &quot;Say You Love Me,&quot; &quot;The Chain,&quot; &quot;Don't Stop&quot;) from Fleetwood Mac and Rumours here attest. They could have arguably repeated that mega-successful\nformula for a decade, but chose a more musically expansive tack, represented &quot;Sara,&quot; Think About Me&quot; and the other core tracks drawn from the ambitious Tusk. While the band's megahit luster faded as the solo careers of Buckingham and Nicks took flight in the '80s, their power was still apparent in the dusky-bright pop of Christine McVie's &quot;Hold Me&quot; and &quot;Little Lies.&quot; Sequenced with compelling listening rather than chronology in mind, this set also includes the strongest of the Mac's latter-day recordings (Nicks's &quot;Paper Doll,&quot; &quot;Silver Springs,&quot; and\n&quot;No Questions Asked&quot;; McVie's &quot;As Long As You Follow&quot;), as well the Lindsey Buckingham showcases &quot;Go Insane&quot; and &quot;Big Love&quot; from '97's The Dance. --Jerry McCulley\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n     CD1\n\n01.Monday morning                                       [02:45]\n02.Dreams                                               [04:16]\n03.You make loving fun                                  [03:34]\n04.Go your own way                                      [03:40]\n05.Rhiannon (single version)                            [03:47]\n06.Say you love me                                      [04:04]\n07.I'm so afraid (live, 1997)                           [06:01]\n08.Silver springs                                       [04:31]\n09.Over my head (single version)                        [03:09]\n10.Never going back again                               [02:15]\n11.Sara                                                 [06:27]\n12.Love in store                                        [03:11]\n13.Tusk                                                 [03:35]\n14.Landslide                                            [03:18]\n15.Songbird                                             [03:20]\n16.Big love (live, 1997)                                [02:49]\n17.Storms                                               [05:28]\n\n     CD2\n\n01.The chain                                            [04:29]\n02.Don't stop                                           [03:13]\n03.What makes you think you're the one                  [03:31]\n04.Gypsy                                                [04:23]\n05.Second hand news                                     [02:52]\n06.Little lies                                          [03:40]\n07.Think about me                                       [02:43]\n08.Go insane (live, 1997)                               [04:21]\n09.Gold dust woman                                      [05:00]\n10.Hold me                                              [03:45]\n11.Seven wonders                                        [03:38]\n12.World turning                                        [04:24]\n13.Everywhere                                           [03:42]\n14.Sisters of the moon                                  [04:41]\n15.Family man                                           [04:02]\n16.As long as you follow                                [04:18]\n17.No questions asked                                   [04:43]\n18.Skies the limit                                      [03:46]\n19.Paper doll                                           [03:58]\n____\n                      141:19 min\n212,4 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
