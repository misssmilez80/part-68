Everton boss David Moyes has to work on a strictly limited budget, \nbut the Toffees are always difficult opponents, as they demonstrated with a 2-1 victory at City last season. \nElsewhere, newly-promoted Swansea head to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea, while Liverpool host Wolves \nand Stoke take on Manchester United. West Brom boss Roy Hodgson leads his side out against former club Fulham, \nwhile Newcastle meet Blackburn and Wigan host Tottenham.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a33a273b139e6646d0440d1b633fb282897313c5","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+-+24th+September+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a33a273b139e6646d0440d1b633fb282897313c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,58,39,59,19,158,102,70,208,68,13,27,99,63,178,130,137,115,19,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
