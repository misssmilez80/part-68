Kind of a poor-man's &quot;Roller Ball&quot;, &quot;DR2K&quot; is about the ultimate in New America's blood sport in a fascist &quot;near-future&quot;, with David Carradine(&quot;Kung Fu&quot;)as the anti-hero Frankenstein. Produced by Corman, and directed by Paul Bartell(&quot;Eating Raoul&quot;), the film is fast-paced, blackly humorous, and well-made. Unlike many Corman cheapies, the stark, spartan setting of &quot;DR2K&quot; only adds to the bleak atmosphere, where Mr. President rules from overseas, and old folks are routinely euthanized as part of the game. The game, in this case, being the Transcontinental Road Race where anything goes, and where pedestrians are run over and assigned kill points. Carradine plays a darkly foreboding Frankenstein, so-called because of the many limbs he has lost as a result of running the Death Race. A pre-&quot;Rocky&quot; Sylvester Stallone is grand as Machine-Gun Joe Viterbo, Frankenstein's arch-rival. Also stars Mary Woronov(&quot;Eating Raoul&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll High School&quot;)as Calamity Jane, Roberta Collins(&quot;Eaten Alive&quot;, &quot;Hardbodies&quot;)delightful as Matilda the Hun, and 60's DJ Don Steele as a mincing little announcer. One of Corman's many little social cowmentaries, this one about the all-too American obsession for violence and sports; thankfully he allows Bartell to deftly and briskly direct. Still, it's a fairly low-budget affair; pedetrians get crushed, and things git blowed up real good, but it only makes you wonder what the film cud have been with a larger budget. Oh well, at least there isn't a giant evil pickle from Venus in this one... The MooCow says this Guilty Pleasure is definitely rentable, so just yell &quot;Blitzkrieg!&quot; and fire up that vcr!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072856/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072856/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bd3430f6fa474b06f3f43108b476ac23178b6e0","amp;dn":"Death+Race+2000%281975%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bd3430f6fa474b06f3f43108b476ac23178b6e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,211,67,15,111,164,116,176,111,63,67,16,139,71,106,194,49,120,182,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
