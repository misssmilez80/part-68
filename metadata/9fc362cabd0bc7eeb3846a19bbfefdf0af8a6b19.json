The field of integrated modeling, combining optics, mechanics, control engineering, and other disciplines, is the subject of this book. Although the book primarily focuses on ground-based optical telescopes, the techniques introduced are applicable also to other wavelengths and to other opto-mechanical applications on the ground or in space. Basic tools of integrated modeling are introduced together with concepts of ground-based telescopes. Modeling of optical systems, structures, wavefront control systems with emphasis on segmented mirror control, and active and adaptive optics are described together with a variety of noise sources; many examples are included in this book. Integrated Modeling of Telescopes is a text for physicists and engineers working in the field of opto-mechanical design and wavefront control, but it will also be valuable as a textbook for PhD students.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 560 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 2011 edition (August 24, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1461401488\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1461401483","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fc362cabd0bc7eeb3846a19bbfefdf0af8a6b19","amp;dn":"Integrated+Modeling+of+Telescopes+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fc362cabd0bc7eeb3846a19bbfefdf0af8a6b19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,195,98,202,189,11,199,238,179,132,106,25,187,254,253,240,175,138,107,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
