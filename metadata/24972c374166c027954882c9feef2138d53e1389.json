In using both formats, Tati\nfeared that Thomson-color might not be practicable, a concern that proved well-\nfounded after the Thomson firm went bankrupt before the film could be\nprocessed. Tati then released the black-and-white version (which features\noccasional short bursts of colour, hand-coloured by Tati directly onto the\nframes). In 1995, new technology allowed the restoration of the color copy,\nwhich was finished and released by Tati's daughter Sophie Tatischeff\nand cinematographer FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Ede.\n\n\nJour de fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªte tells the story of an inept and easily distracted French mailman\nwho frequently interrupts his duties to converse with the local inhabitants,\nas well as inspect the traveling fair that has come to his small community.\nInfluenced by too much wine and a newsreel account of rapid transportation\nmethods used by the United States postal system, he goes to hilarious\nlengths to speed the delivery of mail while aboard his bicycle.\n\nStarring: Jacques Tati, Guy Decomble and Paul Frankeur \nDirector: Jaques Tati\n\n\nVideo: MPEG2PAL 4:3 720x576 (both versions)\n\nAudio: French Dolby AC-3/2 (both versions)\n\nSubs: Dansk, Norsk, Suomi, Svenska (both versions)\n\nExtras: (color version only)\n        Soigne ton gauche [1936]\n        L' Ecole des facteurs [1947]\n        Cours du Soir [1961]\n\n        Biography: Jaques Tati\n\n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040497/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040497/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24972c374166c027954882c9feef2138d53e1389","amp;dn":"Jour+de+Fete+%28Tati%29+b+and+w+%2B+color+Nordic+subs++DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24972c374166c027954882c9feef2138d53e1389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,151,44,55,65,102,192,39,149,72,130,201,254,239,33,56,213,62,19,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
