Influences range from Steely Dan to Howard Jones, Mike Oldfield to Miles Davis.\n\nPlease download this, please post any feedback or comments and enjoy.\n\nQuote from Youtube...\n\n&quot;Hello,\n\nI have just completed mixing and mastering my first and hopefully annual CD/download!\n\nIt is called 'Transfusion' and the title reflects my experiences over the past few years as i have been slowly reprogramming myself to better cope with todays less compassionate world. It is also a play on wordsÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿ about the styles of music presented within. \n\nIt contains 13 original tracks, all composed, performed and programmed by me. It is completely instrumental and somewhat eclectic, however I am excited about the running order as it has framed each song nicely and maintained an overall theme\n\nMany of theÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿ songs have appeared on the Youtube page in earlier versions, hence the V numbers after many of the titles there, though I have spent considerable time tidying them up, fixing fades &amp; intros, etc and I have also made some alterations to bring each of them closer to my visions.\n\nI would like to thank each and every viewer of my Youtube page as they are the ones that have continued to keep the momentum in my work, it is for them that ultimately this work is dedicated to.\n\nSo, until my next post and news of my plans beyond this project, please do what you can to keep yours and others negative emotions at bay, serve others and other sentient beings and if you cannot, please refrain from harming them.\n\nPeace, Namaste.\n\nSteve&quot;\n\nTrack Listing:- \n1. Easily Said\n2. Your Last Goodbye\n3. Coming Back to Life (Real Song)\n4. Never Ever\n5. Stars\n6. Holdontoyou\n7. Path to Joy\n8. This is Your Life\n9. Miles Apart\n10. Europa\n11. Unlimited\n12. Watch You Go\n13. Magic Wave\n\nArtwork to follow.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bf70482fe495604d17163aedaac25b5c24ea691","amp;dn":"Steve+Wilde+-+Transfusion+%28CD+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bf70482fe495604d17163aedaac25b5c24ea691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,247,4,130,254,73,86,4,209,113,99,174,218,172,37,181,194,78,166,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
