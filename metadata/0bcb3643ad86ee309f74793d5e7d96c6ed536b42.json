And here is a quick guide to all the various Editions we offer.\nSimplicity Linux 11.10 Obsidian: (112mb)\nObsidian is a cut down to the bone edition of Simplicity Linux.  You get JWM as a window manager, Firefox and a network manager, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about it.  It is designed for putting on a USB key when you just need a web browser and nothing else getting in the way and taking up processor and memory resources.\nSimplicity Linux 11.10 Netbook: (124mb)\nNetbook Edition does what it says on the tin.  It is designed to be used on a netbook rather than a desktop.  Most of the applications are web based rather than being locally installed.  If you use the internet more than you use local apps, this is the one for you. It is designed to be small and light for fast bootup and fast use on Netbooks which have more modest specs.  It also uses XFCE as the window manager.\nSimplicity Linux 11.10 Desktop: (379mb)\nDesktop Edition is almost the opposite of Netbook.  It is the Edition we personally use on our production laptop.  All the applications are preinstalled for you locally.  It is a big download but you do get the full, uncut version of LibreOffice, as well as several other large applications.  And as with the other Editions, it comes with XFCE as the default window manager.\nSimplicity Linux 11.10 Media:\nMedia is our newest and most experimental Edition.  Here at Simplicity Linux we listen to a lot of music and watch a lot of TV and movies.  So we created Simplicity Linux Media.  If you have a VGA port enabled TV, you can hook up a modest box to a TV and create a lounge PC.  It comes with iPlayer, TVCatchup, Grooveshark, Google Books, and Blinkbox to help you out with all your media requirements. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://simplicitylinux.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://simplicitylinux.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(support page)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bcb3643ad86ee309f74793d5e7d96c6ed536b42","amp;dn":"SimplicityMedia1110.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bcb3643ad86ee309f74793d5e7d96c6ed536b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,203,54,67,173,134,238,48,159,116,121,61,94,125,150,198,237,83,107,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
