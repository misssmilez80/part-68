This was a treat, not just for fans of HallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relentless acerbity, but because the genre boasts some enduring classics: Paris, Texas and Badlands are among the all-time great films.\nDriving through those badlands of South Dakota to the mountains of Montana, Hall stripped down the genreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s appeal. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA true road movie is about escape from oppression: itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a literal portrayal of rebellion.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ A prime example, he said, would be Thelma &amp; Louise, because people could identify with that rebellion. Punctuating his witty observations were film clips, interviews with historians and shots of the spacious vistas so integral to road movies.\nThe best part of the 90-minute documentary came when Hall, defending the reputation of muscle cars, unleashed an unexpected diatribe against Jeremy Clarkson, whom he called the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œill-informed and overhyped god of all things automotiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll tell you that [a muscle car] canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t compare to a Ferrari,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he ranted. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBut comparing a muscle car to a Ferrari is like comparing Jeremy Clarkson to a real television host. If this car was a woman itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be Elizabeth Taylor. If Jeremy Clarkson were a woman, I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be a goddamn bit surprised.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSource MPEG2/MPA TS\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (720x400)\nVCodec: XviD (2 pass MPEG)\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 720*400\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47b549bac3d4118de2393d893c4467b0441bb43e","amp;dn":"Rich+Hall%5C%27s+%5C%27Continental+Drifters%5C%27_+XviD+AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47b549bac3d4118de2393d893c4467b0441bb43e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,181,73,186,195,212,17,141,226,57,61,137,60,68,103,176,68,27,180,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
