The children dismount and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ except for one ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ walk towards a bright light in the sky.\n\nIn 2009 the authorities have become alarmed by reports that every child on Earth became motionless at exactly the same time. A few hours later the same thing happens again, but this time the children deliver a chilling message en masse: &quot;We are coming.&quot; As Torchwood investigates the affair in Cardiff, in London the Permanent Secretary to the Home Office, John Frobisher, is also trying to manage the crisis. The government then receives a secret transmission from an alien species referred to only as &quot;456&quot; who have apparently made contact with Earth before. Whatever took place on that occasion, it is a secret so terrible that Frobisher orders the death of all those involved in the affair ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which includes Captain Jack Harkness and, by extension, all other members of Torchwood. As the team go on the run, the world waits for the impending arrival of the aliens. Over the next few days, humanity will discover just what lengths it will go ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and to what depths it will sink ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to ensure its own survival.\n\n-- Miracle Day\nTorchwood: Miracle Day is the fourth series of Torchwood, which began airing on Starz on July 8, 2011, and is a ten-part miniseries, similar to Children Of Earth but longer; covering the equivalent screen time as 20 episodes of the original Doctor Who series, this makes it the longest single storyline in the history of the franchise (Doctor Who's record is 14 half-hour episodes). It is a BBC America / Starz co-production that's set in both Britain and America. Miracle Day is set after the traumatic events of Children of Earth.\n\nThe premise is that people on Earth have stopped dying, mystifying experts and straining the Earth's resources. Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) and Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), the last members of the Torchwood team, reunite and go to America, where they are helped by CIA secret agents Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer) and Esther Drummond (Alexa Havins), as well as others sympathetic to their cause.\n\nIn a bit of a role reversal from previous airing schedules of both Doctor Who and Torchwood, The American channel Starz aired the episodes first and then aired in Britain a week later (with Canada and Australia airing them in-between).\n\nFormatted to work on iPods.\n\n\n\nSeason 3 - Children of Earth\n301 - Day One ................ 58:26\n302 - Day Two ................ 58:12\n303 - Day Three .............. 58:38\n304 - Day Four ............... 59:29\n305 - Day Five ............... 58:13\n\n\n\nSeason 4 - Miracle Day\n401 - The New World .......... 51:13\n402 - Rendition .............. 53:43\n403 - Dead of Night .......... 55:35\n404 - Escape to L.A. ......... 56:28\n405 - The Categories of Life . 53:01\n406 - The Middle Men ......... 53:04\n407 - Immortal Sins .......... 52:45\n408 - End of the Road ........ 54:09\n409 - The Gathering .......... 55:22\n410 - The Blood Line ......... 56:06","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d8b9f9b0db0fea2062a78167bb06a6ff3abb308","amp;dn":"Torchwood+Seasons+3+and+4+-+iPod+Compatible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d8b9f9b0db0fea2062a78167bb06a6ff3abb308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,139,159,155,13,176,254,162,6,42,120,22,123,176,106,111,243,171,179,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
