In haste, IsmaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©l and Mouloud go to Marseilles where an uncle lives. Nouredine has died in a fire, and IsmaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©l feels guilt on top of grief. IsmaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©l becomes friends with Jacky, a white man whose father and brother hate immigrants. Mouloud hangs out with cousin Rhida who breaks Islamic rules and deals hash. IsmaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©l decides Mouloud must return to Tunisia, but the boy runs off, becoming an acolyte to Rhida's supplier. IsmaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©l and Jacky's Arab girlfriend start an affair, friends betray friends, and the racism gets ugly. Can IsmaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©l rescue himself and Mouloud or will life in France crush them?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1fb03bbc36ce22b7ccbf96f11b745edc2f0f2db","amp;dn":"Bye-Bye+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1fb03bbc36ce22b7ccbf96f11b745edc2f0f2db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,251,3,187,195,108,226,43,124,203,249,111,17,183,69,237,194,240,242,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
