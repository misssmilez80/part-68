What are the odds ??\n\n\\&quot;A Deck of Aces\\&quot; was so popular that in the next season, \na sequel \\&quot;One Ace Too Many\\&quot; was made.\n\nGuest Stars --- Alan Oppenheimer, Linda Gaye Scott, \nCharles Dierkop, and Bern Hoffman.   With Ray Teal as Sheriff Roy Coffee.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9de432c2f40417ae0712891a0f5928e4481233c","amp;dn":"BONANZA+--+A+Deck+of+Aces+%28+12th+Season+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9de432c2f40417ae0712891a0f5928e4481233c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,222,67,44,47,64,65,122,224,113,40,145,160,245,146,142,68,129,35,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
