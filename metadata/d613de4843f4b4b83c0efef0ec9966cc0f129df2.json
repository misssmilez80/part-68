The genius of the lyrics, audacity of the conception, and beat and swing of the music sent its audience spinning into the night. Since then writer Casey Bennetto has teamed up with director Neil Armfield to make his outlandish and biting musical bigger and better than ever. Keating! has taken Australia by storm enjoying sold-out seasons, receiving numerous awards, rave reviews and standing ovations.\n\nRated: M\nDuration: 96 mins\nReleased: 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d613de4843f4b4b83c0efef0ec9966cc0f129df2","amp;dn":"Keating+the+Musical","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d613de4843f4b4b83c0efef0ec9966cc0f129df2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,19,222,72,67,244,180,184,60,14,254,240,236,153,102,204,15,18,157,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
