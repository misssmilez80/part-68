If a comparison had to be made, the less commercial end of Thea Gilmore's catalogue would be as good a reference point as any. \n\nEasy on the ear, built on a subtle soft folk rock base and Emily's rich emotive vocals, Believer is a grower that benefits from repeated plays. While it never quite rocks out, I'd Rather Be has a Tom Petty I Won't Back Down vibe, and as whole the album would sit neatly next to the excellent Katy Lied Echo Games album. \n\nBeliever will surely move Emily onto the next base. From there, only fate knows, but the future looks bright. \n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/02/11/emily-maguire/[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a8e9d215387830f376df6545bdec171b0a71cab","amp;dn":"Emily+Maguire...Believer%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a8e9d215387830f376df6545bdec171b0a71cab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,142,157,33,83,135,131,15,55,109,246,84,91,222,193,113,176,167,28,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
