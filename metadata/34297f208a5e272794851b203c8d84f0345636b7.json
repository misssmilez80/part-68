Bogarde apparently regarded it as a &quot;non-event,&quot; and it is not perfect (an at times confused mix of comedy, drama, and romance), but it has a great cast, is relatively short, and I always enjoyed it.  It has not been available before, so I thought I would upload it for anyone who, like me, had trouble finding it.  You can purchase a decent all-regions DVD copy on eBay.\n\nThis is my first upload.  Hope I did it OK.  Thanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34297f208a5e272794851b203c8d84f0345636b7","amp;dn":"Sebastian+%281968%29%2C+with+Dirk+Bogarde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34297f208a5e272794851b203c8d84f0345636b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,41,127,32,138,94,39,39,148,133,27,32,60,141,132,240,52,86,54,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
