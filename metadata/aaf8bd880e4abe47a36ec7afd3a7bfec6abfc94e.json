Pedersen, Arlyn M. Myers \nBrooks Cole | January 2010 | PDF | ISBN 10: 0495829935 | 432 pages | 16 mb\nAmazon Link : http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Principles-Organic-Chemistry-Laboratory/dp/0495829935/\n\nClass-tested by thousands of students and using simple equipment and green chemistry ideas, UNDERSTANDING THE PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY: A LABORATORY COURSE includes 36 experiments that introduce traditional, as well as recently developed synthetic methods. Offering up-to-date and novel experiments not found in other lab manuals, this innovative book focuses on safety, gives students practice in the basic techniques used in the organic lab, and includes microscale experiments, many drawn from the recent literature. An Online Instructor's Manual available on the book's instructor's companion website includes helpful information, including instructors' notes, pre-lab meeting notes, experiment completion times, answers to end-of-experiment questions, video clips of techniques, and more.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface to the Student xi\nPreface to the Instructor xiv\nThe Front Cover: NatureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Organic Chemistry Laboratory xix\n\nPART I Theory and Techniques\nChapter 1 Safety in the Chemistry Laboratory 3\nChapter 2 The Laboratory Notebook and the Laboratory Period 9\nChapter 3 Where to Find It: Searching the Literature 13\nChapter 4 Things You Need to Know Before You Begin 15\nChapter 5 Properties of Organic Molecules 31\nChapter 6 Characteristic Physical Properties of Pure Compounds 53\nChapter 7 Isolation and Purification of Compounds 89\nChapter 8 Structure Determination 141\nChapter 9 Running a Synthetic Reaction 201\n\nPART II Experiments \nExperiment 1 Calibrating a Pasteur Pipette 211\nExperiment 2 Investigating Solubility and Acid-Base Reactions 214\nExperiment 3 Mixed Melting Points 219\nExperiment 4 Whittling Down the Possibilities: Identifying an Unknown Using Molecular\nDipole Moment, Solubility, Density, and Boiling Point Data 224\nExperiment 5 Recrystallization and Melting Points: Recrystallization of Adipic\nand Salicylic Acids 230\nExperiment 6 Recrystallization and Melting Points: Recrystallization of an Unknown\nSolid and Decolorization of Brown Sugar 236\nExperiment 7 Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) 241\nExperiment 8 Identification of an Adulterated Herb or Spice by Thin Layer\nChromatography (TLC) 246\nExperiment 9 What Do You Take for Pain? 253\nExperiment 10 Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions of Alkyl Halides 257\nExperiment 11 Isolation of Trimyristin from Nutmeg 261\nExperiment 12 The MagtrieveTM Oxidation of 4-Chlorobenzyl Alcohol,\nA Solvent-Free Reaction 268\nExperiment 13 The Sodium Borohydride Reduction of Benzil and Benzoin 273\nExperiment 14 The Grignard Reaction: The Preparation of 1,1-Diphenylethanol 278\nExperiment 15 The Asymmetric Dihydroxylation of trans-Stilbene 285\nExperiment 16 Some Chemistry of a-Pinene Oxide 291\nExperiment 17 A Dehydrogenation/Hydrogenation Reaction 296\nExperiment 18 The Friedel-Crafts Reaction 303\nExperiment 19 Microwave Heating of Organic Compounds 307\nExperiment 20 The Reaction of 1,1-Diphenylethanol on Clay in the Presence\nof Microwave Radiation 312\nExperiment 21 The Wittig Reaction 316\nExperiment 22 The Suzuki Reaction 321\nExperiment 23 The Crossed-Aldol Condensation 326\nExperiment 24 Identifying the Structure of an Aldehyde by Qualitative Analysis 331\nExperiment 25 The Benzoin Reaction 338\nExperiment 26 The Diels-Alder Reaction 344\nExperiment 27 Synthesis of an a,b-Unsaturated Carboxylic Acid Derivative 348\nExperiment 28 The Reaction of 2-Acetylphenyl Benzoate with Potassium Hydroxide.\nPart I 355\nExperiment 29 The Reaction of 2-Acetylphenyl Benzoate with Potassium Hydroxide.\nPart II 359\nExperiment 30 Synthesis of 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-b-Carboline 363\nExperiment 31 Base-Catalyzed Hydrolysis of Nicotinonitrile Using an Anion-Exchange\nResin 367\nExperiment 32 Reactions of Salicylamide 371\nExperiment 33 The Hunsdiecker Reaction 377\nExperiment 34 The Investigation of the Mechanism of a Reaction 381\nExperiment 35 Monoterpenes and the Ritter Reaction 385\nExperiment 36 Chemoselectivity in Transfer-Hydrogenation Reactions 389\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf8bd880e4abe47a36ec7afd3a7bfec6abfc94e","amp;dn":"The+Principles+of+Organic+Chemistry++%282010+-+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf8bd880e4abe47a36ec7afd3a7bfec6abfc94e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,248,189,136,14,74,190,71,163,110,199,175,211,167,191,236,106,191,201,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
