Torrent contains a self-extractor you just need to run and a link to a tutorial that'll talk you through what you gotta do for it to run properly. \n\nContains like every fix possible, and should run as a real Mac. VMware Tools are there, along with video drivers and all that lot. Can contact me if you need help (my email is included in the torrent). I'd recommend an email rather than commenting on here if it's urgent.\n\nCheers, seeders are appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca989717b56e1421db486227efaf95cb46fa6bfd","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+Lion+10.7.1+VMware+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca989717b56e1421db486227efaf95cb46fa6bfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,152,151,23,181,110,20,33,219,72,98,39,239,175,149,203,70,250,107,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
