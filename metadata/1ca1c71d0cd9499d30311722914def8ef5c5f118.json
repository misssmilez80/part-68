The playlist tells a musically journey through a variety of less well known songs and sounds. Songs and sounds that survived the might of exclusion and in which sharing is enjoying (for me). A Bit of Fuel for the soul. \n\nI think this is a reasonable attempt in reaching out to a lot of people, who like to listen to real, honest music as well (and which is suitable for the late hours too :)).\n\n\nDutch Sweet - 001 Hide &amp; Seek (Easy Listening)\n\n01 - Old Man Took (America)\n02 - If This World Were Mine (Luther Vandross)\n03 - Reasons Why (Nickel Creek)\n04 - Paper Aeroplane (Angus &amp; Julia Stone)\n05 - Depende (Jarabe De Palo)\n06 - Shack Up (Nouvelle Vague)\n07 - Rodeo Clowns (Jack Johnson)\n08 - Como La Vida (Hanna)\n09 - One Sweet Love (Sara Bareilles)\n10 - Beijos, Blues E Poesia (Ksis)\n11 - La Bell Dame Sans Regrets (Sting)\n12 - When There is Time For Love (Gowan)\n13 - Playground (Sia)\n14 - Come Round Soon (Sara Bareilles)\n15 - In Assenza Di Te (Laura Pausini)\n16 - I'm Confessin (Lizz Wright)\n17 - Not Going Anywhere (Keren Ann)\n18 - In A Manner Of Speaking (Camille)\n19 - Essere Una Donna (Anna Tatangelo)\n20 - To Let (Xavier Rudd)\n21 - Why Can't We Live Together (Sade)\n22 - Stop This World (Diana Krall)\n23 - Basin St Blues (Peggy Lee)\n24 - Leave Me Standing Alone (Lizz Wright)\n25 - Ordinary People (John Legend)\n26 - All Would Envy (Chris Botti &amp; Shawn Colvin)\n27 - The Blower's Daughter (Damien Rice)\n28 - Up Above My Head (I Hear Music In The Air) (Ruthie Foster)\n29 - Return To Oz (Scissor Sisters)\n30 - Lonely Too (Ilse Delange)\n31 - I Can't Help It (Gretchen Parlato)\n32 - Hide &amp; Seek (Imogen Heap)\n33 - Je Suis Venu Te Dire Que Je M En Vais (Claude Monnet)\n34 - In Your Back (Keren Ann)\n35 - Play In Reverse (Lex Land)\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ca1c71d0cd9499d30311722914def8ef5c5f118","amp;dn":"VA+Easy+Listening+-+Hide+%26amp%3B+Seek+%28Dutch+Sweet+01+HQ+MP3+VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ca1c71d0cd9499d30311722914def8ef5c5f118","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,161,199,29,12,217,73,157,48,49,23,34,145,77,239,142,245,197,241,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
