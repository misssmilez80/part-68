During an encounter with Strom and his men, who are loading a semi-trailer truck with stolen cars, Powell is murdered. Pulovski, despite efforts to catch the criminals on the highway, ends up losing them.\n\nConsequently, Pulovski is removed from the case by his superior, Lt. Raymond Garcia, and given a new partner, David Ackerman, a young officer recently promoted, who has continual nightmares and is plagued by guilt over his brother\\'s death, believing it was his fault as a child. Against regulations, Pulovski and Ackerman start investigating the Strom case. Pulovski tracks down a man working for Strom named Morales, whom he forces to cooperate. Morales, under Pulovski\\'s instructions, manages to plant a two-way radio inside Strom\\'s house without getting caught, but is still murdered later on by Strom\\'s companion Liesl. Feeling pressured by the authorities, Strom deduced that there was a connection between Morales and another one of his operatives named Little Felix. Unbeknown to Strom earlier, Little Felix had also been secretly working as an informant for Pulovski regarding the disclosure of his illegal activities at his wrecking yards.\n\nThrough the listening device, Pulovski and Ackerman learn that Strom is planning to leave the country after robbing a local casino of two million dollars. Strom\\'s men set off smoke bombs inside the casino and capture the general manager, Alphonse (Anthony Alexander), forcing him to open the vault for them. Inside the vault however, are Pulovski and Ackerman, who had conspired with Alphonse to capture Strom. Yet Liesl, knowing of Ackerman\\'s naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯vete, dares him and distracts Pulovski long enough for Strom to pin the detective down to the floor. Liesl shoots Ackerman in the back; although he is not injured due to his bulletproof vest. But moments later, one of Strom\\'s men, Cruz (Pete Randall), discovers that the vault is empty. With police surrounding the building, Strom takes Pulovski hostage and demands the two million dollars as a ransom.\n\nIn trying to determine Pulovski\\'s whereabouts, Ackerman tracks down one of Strom\\'s henchmen named Loco. Loco, however, manages to elude Ackerman following a violent encounter with him at a dry cleaners where Little Felix is also found murdered. Ackerman then decides to turn to his father Eugene, for help in securing the ransom money, which he reluctantly agrees to. While at his father\\'s office, Ackerman\\'s girlfriend Sarah (Lara Flynn Boyle), informs him over the phone that Lt. Garcia is at their house waiting to interrogate him. Just then, Ackerman is visited by two detectives, who claim that Garcia is at headquarters and has sent them to retrieve him over his alleged forbidden involvement in the Strom case. Ackerman suddenly realizes that there is only one person capable of impersonating Garcia; Loco, with Ackerman\\'s badge which he acquired by stealing it from him during a previous encounter at a bar. Ackerman evades the detectives and races home on a borrowed motorcycle. During an ensuing physical confrontation between the two men, Sarah grabs Ackerman\\'s gun and kills Loco. Ackerman is distraught, as he needed Loco alive to tell him where Pulovski is being held captive. However, Ackerman later notices Loco\\'s car outside their door, a bizarrely colored Lotus, which he and Pulovski spotted earlier at a warehouse in which one of Strom\\'s mechanics, Max, was working on.\n\nAfter killing Max in a struggle within an elevator shaft, Pulovski is rescued by Ackerman. The pair escape the warehouse by driving a Mercedes convertible through a wall and Pulovski quotes a Mercedes Benz commercial, Engineered like no other car and later capture Cruz, whom Strom sent to collect the ransom. As the group arrives at the airport, Cruz gives Strom the money and is murdered. Pulovski and Ackerman open fire at the scene as a situation is created where one of Strom\\'s men, Blackwell, in charge of flying him out of the country aboard a private jet, is killed following a collision with a commercial airliner. Ackerman later pursues Liesl into the airport and kills her, while Pulovski attempts to shoot Strom during his own chase, but ends up out of ammunition. Strom shoots Pulovski, and prepares to kill him when Ackerman arrives, and shoots Strom. Seriously injured, Strom collapses onto a luggage conveyor belt. Pulovski climbs on, and to avenge Powell and end the homicide spree there, kills him despite Strom\\'s requests for medical attention. Sometime later, Pulovski, Ackerman and Garcia have been promoted. Ackerman is now a detective and Pulovski the new Lieutenant (Garcia\\'s new position is left unrevealed). Pulovski introduces Ackerman to another \\&quot;rookie\\&quot; cop, Playboy hottie Heather Torres (Roberta Vasquez), as his new partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRookie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Der AnfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nger (The Rookie) ist eine US-amerikanische ActionkomÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶die von Clint Eastwood aus dem Jahr 1990.\n\n\n \n\nDer Polizist Nick Pulovski, der sich mit AutodiebstÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤hlen beschÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ftigt, gilt als nicht besonders erfolgreich. Er kommt jedoch dahinter, dass Strom zahlreiche AutodiebstÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤hle organisiert. Der Partner von Pulovski wird getÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tet, der AnfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nger David Ackerman wird ihm als neuer Partner zugewiesen. Ackerman wurde erst kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rzlich zum Polizeidetektiv befÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rdert. Er ist seit dem Tod seines Bruders in der Kindheit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ wofÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼r er sich verantwortlich fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hlt ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ traumatisiert. Nun muss Ackerman lernen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ob er will oder nicht ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ wie man mit Killern fertig wird.\n\nObwohl der Mordfall dem Morddezernat ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼bergeben wurde, ermittelt Pulovski in dieser Angelegenheit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ entgegen der Meinung seines Partners ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ gegen Strom. Als die beiden Polizisten ihn bei einem versuchten KasinoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼berfall stellen wollen, wird Pulovski von den Verbrechern als Geisel genommen und Ackerman ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼berlebt nur dank einer kugelsicheren Weste. Ackerman wird suspendiert, sucht jedoch im Alleingang nach seinem Partner und kann ihn retten.\n\nIm Finale jagen Pulovski und Ackerman Strom und seine Geliebte auf einem Flughafen und durch das AbfertigungsgebÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ude. Sie trennen sich und verfolgen jeweils einen der Verbrecher. Ackerman tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tet die Gangsterbraut per Kopfschuss, obwohl er sie zuvor bereits kampfunfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤hig geschossen hat. AnschlieÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸end rettet er Pulovski, der kurz davor steht von Strom getÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tet zu werden. Dieser tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tet darauf den bereits ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼berwÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltigten Strom ebenfalls per Kopfschuss.\n\nAm Filmende ist Pulovski befÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rdert und der neue Leiter der Polizeiabteilung; Ackerman, jetzt kein AnfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nger mehr, bekommt als neuen Partner eine junge Polizistin zugeteilt.\n\nKritiken Jack Sommersby schrieb auf efilmcritic.com, ein paar Momente seien ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾nett schrulligÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ, aber ansonsten sei der Film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾nicht aufregendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾langweiligÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ und ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾formelhaftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ.\n\nHintergrund Der Film wurde in Los Angeles, in San JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© und in Saratoga gedreht.\n\n\n - aus Wikipedia, der freien EnzyklopÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤die\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79f752fcd9f6c7282f1564c77cc402734f972be6","amp;dn":"The+Rookie+%281990+film%29+-+-+Rookie+%26acirc%3B%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Der+Anf%26Atilde%3B%26curr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79f752fcd9f6c7282f1564c77cc402734f972be6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,247,82,252,217,246,199,40,47,21,100,199,124,196,2,115,79,151,43,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
