Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 sadly isn't the disc it ideally could be, but it nonetheless summarizes how steady Korn were over the years, developing their sound oh so slightly from one album to the next and, in the process, coming up with several unquestionably killer songs every go-round. The band's six full-lengths resulted in enough of those killer songs to fill this best-of to the brim; in fact, there are quite a few more that could have been compiled here as well if there were more space on this single-disc release (a double disc would have been definitive). As it stands, however, practically every song here is a highlight in and of itself, with the sole exceptions of the below-par ballad-like &quot;Alone I Break&quot; and a space-wasting pair of album-opening covers: Cameo's &quot;Word Up!&quot; and Pink Floyd's &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Pts. 1-3.&quot; These covers are here undoubtedly to bait the legions of Korn fans who already own all the band's albums but are loyal enough to purchase this best-of just for this pair of new recordings. \n\n  \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Word up!
