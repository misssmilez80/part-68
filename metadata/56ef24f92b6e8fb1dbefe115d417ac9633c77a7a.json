I expect many will purchase it and I strongly recommend it for all college libraries.&quot; (The Geographical Journal, 2011)\n\n&quot;But these caveats notwithstanding, Featherstone has written an excellent and often passionate account of the relational geographies of counter-global resistance that makes important contributions to debates on social movements, resistance, and space; it will become a landmark text in the political geographies of resistance.&quot; (Area, 2011)\n\n&quot;Overall I would highly recommend this work to anyone who wishes to understand volcanoes from a global perspective.&quot; (Bull Volcanol, 2011)\n\n&quot;The Volcanoes will satisfy everybody interested in this fascinating topic, but most of all this textbook is written for volcanologists, and advanced undergraduate and graduate students in Earth sciences.&quot; (Pure &amp; Applied Geophysics (PAGEOPH), 1 November 2010)\n\n&quot;Essential.

Without volcanic activity, life as we know it would not exist on our planet. Although beautiful to behold, volcanoes are also potentially destructive, and understanding their nature is critical to prevent major loss of life in the future.\n\nRichly illustrated with over 300 original color photographs and diagrams the book is written in an informal manner, with minimum use of jargon, and relies heavily on first-person, eye-witness accounts of eruptive activity at both &quot;red&quot; (effusive) and &quot;grey&quot; (explosive) volcanoes to illustrate the full spectrum of volcanic processes and their products. Decades of teaching in university classrooms and fieldwork on active volcanoes throughout the world have provided the authors with unique experiences that they have distilled into a highly readable textbook of lasting value. Questions for Thought, Study, and Discussion, Suggestions for Further Reading, and a comprehensive list of source references make this work a major resource for further study of volcanology.\n\nVolcanoes maintains three core foci:\n\n    * Global perspectives explain volcanoes in terms of their tectonic positions on Earth and their roles in earth history\n    * Environmental perspectives describe the essential role of volcanism in the moderation of terrestrial climate and atmosphere\n    * Humanitarian perspectives discuss the major influences of volcanoes on human societies. This latter is especially important as resource scarcities and environmental issues loom over our world, and as increasing numbers of people are threatened by volcanic hazards\n\nReadership\n\nVolcanologists, advanced undergraduate, and graduate students in earth science and related degree courses, and volcano enthusiasts worldwide.\n\n\nA companion website is also available for this title at www.wiley.com/go/lockwood/volcanoes\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 552 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 1 edition (May 25, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1405162503\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1405162500","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56ef24f92b6e8fb1dbefe115d417ac9633c77a7a","amp;dn":"Volcanoes+-+Global+Perspectives+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56ef24f92b6e8fb1dbefe115d417ac9633c77a7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,239,36,249,43,110,143,177,219,239,225,21,212,23,172,150,51,199,122,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
