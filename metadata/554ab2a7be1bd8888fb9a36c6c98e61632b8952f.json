Just as director Christopher Nolan's back-in-black approach is quite different from Tim Burton's phantasmagorical one, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's take doesn't bear much kinship to Elfman's. (You'd be hard-pressed to find any recognizable theme here, for instance.) Mostly the composers remain conservatively subtle, though coming up with the expected pounding on grandiose, action-y selections such as &quot;Myotis&quot; and &quot;Antrozous&quot; (no, the poetic-sounding track names aren't lifted from old Cocteau Twins records but refer to various types of bats). Stand-out track &quot;Tadarida&quot; incorporates some of the distorted vocal effects associated with the Scarecrow's drug-induced nightmarish visions. Atmospheric to the point of evanescence sometime, the individual tracks tend to meld into each other after a while. The sense of stylistic continuity helps establish an overall mood, but sometimes it's hard to distinguish between shades of black. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/4425/picsep4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/4425/picsep4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
