His sentence was reduced after a series of articles by journalist Gary Webb in the San Jose Mercury News brought to light a connection between one of Ross's cocaine sources and the CIA as part of the Iran-Contra scandal. Ross was featured in Kevin Booth's documentary American Drug War: The Last White Hope. \n\nAlex also talks with actress, comedian, writer, television producer and director Roseanne Barr. She has said Wall Street bankers should be sent to re-education camps and if that does not work they should be beheaded. \n\nAlex also continues his coverage of the Occupy Wall Street protests that have fanned out over the country and spread to Europe.   \n\nToday's broadcast went 20 minutes into 4th hour &quot;overDrive&quot; to finish the conversation with Ross and Booth.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
