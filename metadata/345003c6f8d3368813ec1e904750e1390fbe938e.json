Luv then calls his younger brother, associate director Kush (Imran Khan), and asks him to find him a bride. Kush then sets out on the mission to find his brother's bride. He looks everywhere he can, and is then invited over to a rich government officer, Dilip Dixit's (Kanwaljit Singh) house. There he meets their younger daughter Dimple (Katrina Kaif). Dilip would like Kush to get Dimple married to his brother Luv. Kush agrees, until he finally learns who Dimple is. He remembers her, as the film goes back into a flashback. There, Kush and Dimple first met on their college trips and became friends, until Kush leaves for a film-industry life. Dimple then agrees to marry Luv, and during the wedding preparations, Kush and Dimple suddenly fall in love with each other. They therefore call over Piyali, and make her think Luv still fancies her. After a while, they make Luv and Piyali get married secretly, and they run away. Therefore, with no other choice, their parents get Kush and Dimple married. Though, Kush has one condition, which is later agreed to. At the wedding, it is revealed that the condition was that Luv and Piyali could get freely married infront of everyone.\n\n::Trackers::\nCode: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nyaatorrents.info:3277/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nyaatorrents.info:3277/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInfo Hash:345003C6F8D3368813EC1E904750E1390FBE938E\n\n::Screen Shots::\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/90000837903741513056.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/74215144870789644930.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/87277408797927040182.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/79473566905204514825.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/67745770359497750826.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/53836364612749127536.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/57499013830722022425.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/63208766577970360974.png[/img]\n\nwe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\nSearch Silver Release Group at FB\n\n\n::Greetz::\nTo All Silver RG Encoders,AliBaloch,Emad,TrT/TcT,Torrentstate,DarkNight,MXMG,BigW,HDScene RG &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n::Note::\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silvertorrents.me,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:345003c6f8d3368813ec1e904750e1390fbe938e","amp;dn":"Mere+Brother+Ki+Dulhan+2011+480p+DVDRip+Ali+Baloch+Silver+RG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"345003c6f8d3368813ec1e904750e1390fbe938e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,80,3,198,248,211,54,136,19,236,30,144,71,80,225,57,15,190,147,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
