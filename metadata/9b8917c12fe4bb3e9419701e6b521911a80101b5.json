Slowly, he begins to doubt his sanity as increasingly bizarre things start happening at work and at home. Haunted by a deformed co-worker who no one seems to think exists, and an ongoing stream of indecipherable Post-It notes he keeps finding on his fridge, he attempts to investigate what appears to be a mysterious plot against him and, in the process, embroils two women in his madness.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361862/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361862/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b8917c12fe4bb3e9419701e6b521911a80101b5","amp;dn":"The+Machinist+%282004%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b8917c12fe4bb3e9419701e6b521911a80101b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,137,23,193,47,228,187,62,148,25,112,30,107,82,25,17,168,1,1,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
