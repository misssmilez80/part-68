We'll follow Mr. Xtreme on his nightly patrols through the streets of San Diego, as he tries to stop evildoers and protect the innocent. We'll also meet the New York Initiative, a fantastic foursome of real life superheroes living together that tackle crime fighting, one Brooklyn borough at a time. Lead by Zimmer, we'll watch as they take to the streets and try to lure criminals out of hiding with their controversial Bait-Patrols. With over 300 registered superheroes in the United States, we'll definitively uncover the 'Real-Life Superhero' cultural phenomenon and discover what inspired these everyday citizens to take the law in to their own hands as they try to make the world a better and safer place for all.\n\n\n################################################\n\nRatings :6.3/10\nFormat : Avi\nTime : 90 min.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c44e8fabed495a4ff04b89465624a4b697f8387","amp;dn":"Superheroes++2011+%28+AVI+Format+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c44e8fabed495a4ff04b89465624a4b697f8387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,68,232,250,190,212,149,164,255,4,184,148,101,98,74,75,105,127,131,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
