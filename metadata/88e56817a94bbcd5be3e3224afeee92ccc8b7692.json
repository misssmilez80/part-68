So, to maintain a halfway manageable size for a throw away \ndaily talk, we had to reduce crf to 22. (18 and 19 were well over \n2gb.)\n\n-TEAM BAJSKORV\n\nPROPER notes- other release is missing the 5th segment at 31:57. Also\ninstances of bad deinterlacing resulting in choppy and jerky playback.\nHere it is at the 60fps it was filmed in, for a much smoother playback\nand added depth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88e56817a94bbcd5be3e3224afeee92ccc8b7692","amp;dn":"David.Letterman.2011.10.26.Justin.Timberlake.720p.HDTV.x264.PROP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88e56817a94bbcd5be3e3224afeee92ccc8b7692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,229,104,23,169,75,188,213,190,62,50,36,175,238,233,44,204,139,118,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
