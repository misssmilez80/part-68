You need greenluma.\n\nUnlocked all 3 DLCs: \n- Ryder Campaign (but you should know it's not coded in the game yet, when I wrote this)\n- Bloodbath arena \n- Ripper Mod (already works if you're using greenluma without the included game*.dll - this means ripper mod is the only one unlocked if you use greenluma; if u use the included game*.dll file then all 3 DLCs are unlocked) \n\n\nyou need this game*.dll included here for this torrent: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6843265/\nto work, to have arena unlocked.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6bfa0f356c69a66ba5d6346dba93eaf8d4a2e4b","amp;dn":"dead+island+unlock+all+DLCs+%2B+greenluma+2.2.9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6bfa0f356c69a66ba5d6346dba93eaf8d4a2e4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,191,160,243,86,198,154,102,186,93,99,70,219,169,62,175,141,74,46,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
