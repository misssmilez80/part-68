The novels are as follows\n\nCovert One:\nThe Hades Factor\nThe Cassandra Compact\nThe Paris Option\nThe Altman Code\nThe Lazarus Vendetta\nThe Moscow Vector\nThe Arctic Event\n\n\nJason Bourne:\nThe Bourne Identity\nThe Bourne Supremacy\nThe Bourne Ultimatum\nThe Bourne Legacy\nThe Bourne Betrayal\nThe Bourne Sanction\nThe Bourne Deception\nThe Bourne Objective\nThe Bourne Dominion\n\n\nVery clearly, for the record, I did not rip any of these and I have just compiled and converted them to the format I prefer. I have listened to them all, and they all work fine for me. Thanks to all the original posters, which can be found on Demonoid!\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf7124e7d99fbf5f6628b1cacec96665b2a7172","amp;dn":"Jason+Bourne+%26amp%3B+Covert+One+Series+-+Robert+Ludlum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf7124e7d99fbf5f6628b1cacec96665b2a7172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,247,18,78,125,153,251,245,246,98,139,28,172,236,150,102,91,42,113,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
