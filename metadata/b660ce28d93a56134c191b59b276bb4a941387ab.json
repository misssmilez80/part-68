The concert took place at Riverport Amphitheatre, a regular concert venue in Maryland Heights. Approximately 90 minutes into the show during the song Rocket Queen, Axle Rose stopped singing and started yelling for security to take a camera away from a spectator close to the front row. A few seconds later, Axle said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll take it God Da***t and lunged into the crowd. Minutes later the debacle had been broken up. At this point Axle jumped back up on stage and said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Thanks for the security. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m going home. He then threw his microphone down on the stage and walked off. The rest of the band followed. Shortly after the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s departure, unrest began and the crowd started to riot. People tore the seats out of the floor and all of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gear was destroyed. The crowd destroyed everything that could be destroyed. There are many St. Louisans who took damaged material from the concert as a souvenir of the famous riot. The chaos ensued for approximately 45 minutes until police in riot gear finally got the situation under control. When it was all said and done, 90 people were injured and 16 were arrested. The event made national and world news. It would soon be labeled the famous Rocket Queen Riot. Today, regardless of the rioting, I am still a die hard Guns NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roses fan. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sure many other St.Louisans are as well. In the end, we arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t happy that the riot took place but we are happy that Guns NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roses did visit and perform in our great city of St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/8750/rosesliveinstlouis1991d.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/8750/rosesliveinstlouis1991d.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n0=============================0\n\n.: Info Ripping :.\n\nDimensione: 1.36 GB\nDurata: 2:05:46\n\nVideo Codec: DivX 5.1.1\nVideo Bitrate: 1408 kbps\nRisoluzione: 384x272\nFPS: 29.970\nQF: 0.450\n\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 134 kb/s\nFreq Audio: 48000Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b660ce28d93a56134c191b59b276bb4a941387ab","amp;dn":"Guns+N+Roses+-+Live+in+St.+Louis+1991+%5BDVDrip%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b660ce28d93a56134c191b59b276bb4a941387ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,96,206,40,217,58,86,19,76,25,27,89,178,118,187,74,148,19,135,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
