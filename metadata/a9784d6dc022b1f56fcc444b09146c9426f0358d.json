Karl takes the Gospel and his calling very seriously, so when  \n   God calls him to reach out to at-risk young people in his community,   \n   Karl can't say no. The world of the poor, however, is not nearly as    \n   simple as Karl had imagined. As he brings their world into contact     \n   with his own, sparks of conflict and controversy ignite into a scandal \n   that threatens his family, his faith, and the integrity of Evenside    \n   Church. Trapped in a web of secrets, accusations and temptations, Karl \n   must face the shadows that haunt not only the poor, but his own family \n   and church as well. It is a struggle he seems destined to lose -       \n   unless his faith in God's greatness can dispel the doubts that have    \n   befallen his soul and the good people of Evenside.                     \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                    \n                                                                \n                                                           \n                                                                       \n                                                            \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                       \n                                                          \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                                                                          \n                    INSECTS     KiDDoS     GRiLL    FiCO                  \n                                                                          \n                  To the rest of our friends whom all rock.               \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                       \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                           \n                                                                          \n    PRiVATE AFFiLS 100MBit+ (LARGE ARCHIVES ARE A PLUS)                   \n                                                                          \n    PRE-RETAIL OR RETAIL DVDS!                                            \n                                                                          \n    SHELL AND DUMP PROVIDERS                                              \n                                                                          \n    EXPERIENCED XVID ENCODERS                                             \n                                                                          \n                                                                       \n    \n                                                                 \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                        \n                                                        ph^z!SiLK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9784d6dc022b1f56fcc444b09146c9426f0358d","amp;dn":"A.Shepherd.of.Pure.Heart.2005.DVDRip.XViD-DOCUMENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9784d6dc022b1f56fcc444b09146c9426f0358d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,120,77,109,192,34,177,245,111,204,68,75,9,20,108,148,38,240,53,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
