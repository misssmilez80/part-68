This mixtape was made for Pioneer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s competition, and the prize was new mixer. So now you understand the name. In competitions rules it was asked to use filters, and I did so. For the first time of my life. Using EQ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s more ordinary to me\n\nThe songs in mixtape are pretty much new stuff. And more importantly, they are quite hot at the moment. Especially Tom Staar (at least for me), I just lately discovered his productions. Also Wolfgang Gartner said that he is the breakthrough producer of 2011. I also used few mash-ups, since they tend to bring more excitement and unique feel to mix in my opinion.\n\nI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll try to seed as often as possible, and as much as possible. But if you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get any seeds, you can listen mixtape here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.letsmix.com/mix/88374/i_could_use_a_new_mixer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.letsmix.com/mix/88374/i_could_use_a_new_mixer&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTime: 23:38\nQuality: 320 kbps\n\nTracklist:\nTony Junior ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Appeletroen\n\nCarl Tricks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 8090\n\nStarkillers &amp; Dmitry Ko ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Unbelievable\n\nDavid Guetta ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Glasgow\n\nSpencer &amp; Hill feat.
