Find some answers here.\n\n&quot;There is no salvation for civilization, or even the human race, other than the creation of a world government.&quot; - Albert Einstein ... all Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Megiddo I: The March to Armageddon explores Bible prophecy concerning the last day empire prophesied in the Old and New Testaments.

Megiddo I reveals how God uses prophecy to prove His existence and to separate Himself from all others that claim His authority. This informative documentary also chronicles startling quotes from powerful men of history who have spoken of the need for world government to further the cause of peace. But what does the Bible say about &quot;world peace&quot; and its consequence for mankind? Seen through the lens of prophecy, What is the significance of World War I and II? Were these birth pangs to prepare the nations for World War III and Armageddon? &quot;...the end of all things is at hand...&quot; - 1 Peter 4:7\n\nMegiddo: The March to Armageddon explores Bible prophecy concerning the last day empire prophesied in the Old and New Testaments.

I've seen many documentaries, and read a few books, but NEVER have I ever been so informed both in biblical and non-biblical sense about the history of the plans for the new world order. I have both part 1 and 2 but have not yet watched part 2 because part 1 has SO MUCH info in it that you have to either rewind some things, or just wait it out and let your mind absorb all the info that it provides on this issue. If you're like me and you like me, and this end times/ new world order tickles your nerve, get this video.&quot;\n-- Jay\n\n&quot;An accurate Biblical and historical account of prophetic events. Put together very well, especially Daniel's prophecy.&quot;\n-- Kelley Locke, Simi Valley, CA\n\n&quot;It is one of the most fascinating documentaries I have ever seen, largely due to information and history that has been withheld from the public at large.&quot;\n-- James Ainsworth, Fall River, MA\n\n&quot;Excellent. Very comprehensive. The best we have seen.&quot;\n-- Rita Williams, Cephas Ministry\n\n&quot;Very well done. Very powerful, cohesive and to the point.&quot;\n-- Nicole Reagan, Van Nuys, CA\n\n&quot;Substantial and fast paced. Your presentation graphics were fabulous.&quot;\n-- Jim Messenger, Balzers, Lichtenstein\n\n&quot;It is the best presentation I have seen to date.&quot;\n-- Charles Riley, Atlanta, TX\n\n\nMegiddo II - The New Age:\n\nThe Lie of the Serpent is the second part of the controversial Megiddo series, which next focuses on the highly influential New Age movement. But is the New Age really new? Or does it represent the ancient doctrine taught by the serpent to Eve in the Garden of Eden? The answer will startle and amaze you as you learn the influence of the serpent's teaching through the spiritual explosion of occult activity in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nSome of the greatest and most recognized people of the modern era (including Charles Darwin, Thomas Edison, Adolf Hitler and Hillary Clinton) have been influenced by the movement that has re-awakened mankind's communication with the spirit realm, and re-shaped the Western view of God and His relationship to mankind. What are the implications of this &quot;paradigm shift&quot; that seeks to introduce a new global consciousness? Will this new consciousness really bring mankind into the dawning of a golden era? Or the awakening of another dark age?\n\nFull of highly detailed research and exhaustive documentation, Megiddo II challenges even the most skeptical viewer to consider the consequence of the global awakening taking place before our very eyes.\n\nJoin speakers Dave Hunt, Caryl Matrisciana, Dr. Kent Hovind, Pastor Joe Schimmel, and Dr. Stan Monteith who expose the movement that seeks to unite mankind in a one-world religion through the United Nations.\n\nGlobal adherents claim to await a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œuniversal ChristÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to lead the world. What happens to those who will not follow this world leader? And are there sinister warnings against those who refuse to be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinitiatedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ into the New Age?\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!! The First down loaders of my torrents get the Main Hookups on my SERVER.
