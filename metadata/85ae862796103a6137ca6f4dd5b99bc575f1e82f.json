Luna was just two years old when, alone and confused, he found himself on the rugged, wild coast of Vancouver Island.\n\nFollowing his tumultuous life, the film records the human friendships he developed and the trouble this led him into. From death threats to numerous capture attempts by the government, the film-makers watched as people tried to determine his fate.\n\nLuna shows us how quickly our lives can once again cross with the natural world.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85ae862796103a6137ca6f4dd5b99bc575f1e82f","amp;dn":"%28Re+up%5C%27d%29BBC.Natural.World.2010.A.Killer.Whale.Called.Luna+Aka+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85ae862796103a6137ca6f4dd5b99bc575f1e82f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,174,134,39,150,16,58,97,55,202,111,77,213,185,155,197,117,241,232,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
