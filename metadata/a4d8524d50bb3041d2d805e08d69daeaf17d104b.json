Actually it\\'s made by every single 2Pac song I have in my PC.\nSome songs were extracted from videos. There are various 320kbit songs.\nThere are both remixes and originals.\nThere are various songs with the same name - it\\'s because one of them is BASS-optimized.\nThere are some remixes of Pac\\'s songs that I thought were worth including in this collection.\nAs a fan of 2Pac I would suggest checking some T-Bizzy songs too (Never Change and some others) as the king of Rap/Hip-Hop is T-Bizzy\\'s inspiration.\n\nEnjoy this collection and please seed.\t\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KakJgAAdG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KakJgAAdG&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4d8524d50bb3041d2d805e08d69daeaf17d104b","amp;dn":"2Pac+4+Life+Collection++%28M3+Software+-+3ogdy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4d8524d50bb3041d2d805e08d69daeaf17d104b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,216,82,77,80,187,48,65,210,216,5,224,141,105,218,234,241,125,16,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
