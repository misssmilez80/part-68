Combining elements of post-punk, art rock and experimental, the group's sound is further characterized by the visceral rush of garage simmering just atop the surface of their narcotic noise-pop sheen. &quot;\n\n- Jocelynn Loebl, HowlinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Wuelf Media\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Veda Rays are a darkly inspiring spiral galaxy I get immersed in. This is art rock for a tougher crowd.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ David Weiss, founder/editor of www.sonicscoop.com\n\n\n&quot;Akin to numerous legendary ensembles of yore ...The Rays were borne in a swaggering haze of sex, drugs (metaphorically speaking) and of course, rock 'n' roll. Yet unlike a bazillion indie rockers, contemporary and otherwise, the Rays know how to write songs that stick in your memory banks!&quot;     \n\n- Tom Semioli, AMPLIFIER Magazine\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite new bands to come out of Brooklyn.
