Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ba694270de9f99c613549fe2a8c6f5116424057","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+13+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ba694270de9f99c613549fe2a8c6f5116424057","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,166,148,39,13,233,249,156,97,53,73,254,42,140,111,81,22,66,64,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
