The sheer energy produced during a Divine Ascension set has caught many and left them stunned. Experiencing a Divine Ascension show is in-part like stepping into their songs and experiencing the tale there in, and in-part sharing in the bands exhilarating performance that leaves none in its wake.\n\nRecording a roughly cut demo in September 2007, the name Divine Ascension soon brought about a multitude of attention from fans and media alike. Initially, the 3 track CD was recorded to help the band obtain gigs, however, this quickly grew to bigger things once local and national radio stations picked up the CD and spun it numerous times. Interviews were requested and supports with local metal heavy weights ensued, and the name Divine Ascension was soon on the lips of those in the local scene as a fresh new talent not to be missed.\n\nTwo years on from the demo recording and a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“baptism of fireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ touring the local scene, Divine Ascension found themselves in the early stages of recording their full-length debut album. With 12 tracks totalling 60 minutes of music, this release, due October 11, 2011 on NIGHTMARE RECORDS, is bound to receive global attention and see the band obtaining a place as one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best emerging female fronted metal acts. This will not only allow Divine Ascension to storm onto the international metal scene, but will continue to cast the global metal spotlight on the shores of Australia. Many great Australian bands have gone before and are still showing their wares on the international stages, keeping Australia in the hearts of many metal fans as a continuing source of outstanding music.\n\nDivine Ascension is gearing up to show the world they mean business and their debut album will be their spearhead.
