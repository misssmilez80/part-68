Lovely Lynn had little to do in her \nfew remaining shows after this, and the writers did nothing \nto properly write her out of the series. Executive Producer \nQuinn Martin later used her as a guest in his &quot;The Invaders&quot; series.\n\nGuest Stars --- Harold Gould, Pete Duel, Dabney Coleman, Crahan Denton, \nJune Dayton, Lynn Loring (as Barbara Erskine), and the first appearance \nof Lee Meriwether (as Lew's girlfriend Joanna Lauren).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4967750a357520eb66ddb6258d42e72b6164bff2","amp;dn":"THE+FBI+--+Slow+March+Up+a+Steep+Hill+%28+First+Season+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4967750a357520eb66ddb6258d42e72b6164bff2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,103,117,10,53,117,32,235,102,221,182,37,141,66,231,43,97,100,191,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
