Meanwhile, Rex is having really \nuncomfortable difficulties with Circe being a fully welcomed fourth member of his former gang. \nElsewhere (while Breach follows Rex and kidnaps Circe), Providence forces are under attack by \nQuarry using an incredibly strong and powerful mysterious weapon called a molecular destabilzer. \nRex goes to stop him before he completely destroys Providence. Quarry uses the molecular destabilizer \nto disintegrate Rex's active nanites and plans to sell the molecular destabilizer in order to get \nimmunity from even Van Kleiss. Fortunately, the Omega-One Nanite's self-replicating function \ncontinues to supply him with more and more nanites and make a new build (a smaller set of the Smack \nHands but capable of making super-energized molecular energy shields). With the new build, \nRex was able to redirect the destabilizer's blast unto itself and destroy it. Then, Rex was \nable to negotiate with Breach (she was still following Rex) into a deal: Breach releases \nCirce from her private dimension and Rex not only doesn't tell Van Kleiss of this adventure\n(Rex managed to get a recording of Quarry and Breach's conversation, during which she told him everything), \nbut Breach gets to blame this entire crime on Quarry(something Breach was happy about but Quarry was in disagreement).  \n \n  \nSpoken Language:- English\n--------------------------------------------\n\nCast\n------\n\nSeries cast summary:\n \n  Daryl Sabara  ...
