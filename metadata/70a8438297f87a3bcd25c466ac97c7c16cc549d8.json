Another British TV show brought to you courtesy of TheJollyRodgerer.\n\nRandall and Hopkirk (Deceased), Series 1 and 2, in all their AVI glory.  I originally pursued downloading these because I heard that Tom Baker played a character named Wyvern.  And indeed he does.  But for those of us for whom Doctor #4 is THEIR doctor, there's just not enough of him to go round, I'm afraid.\n\nStill in all, a good series - paranormal + detective + mystery + comedy... plus Tom Baker, of course. :)\n\n\n*** REMEMBER, BE A SEEDER, NOT A FEEDER!!! ***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70a8438297f87a3bcd25c466ac97c7c16cc549d8","amp;dn":"Randall+and+Hopkirk+%28Deceased%29+%28Series+1+and+2%29+AVI+by+TheJollyR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70a8438297f87a3bcd25c466ac97c7c16cc549d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,168,67,130,151,248,122,59,205,37,196,102,172,151,199,193,108,197,73,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
