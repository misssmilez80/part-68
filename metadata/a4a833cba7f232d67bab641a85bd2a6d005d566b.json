They have been documented from a number of sources ranging from lay comment to expert testimony verified by video footage of the day's events. Although there are now a number of more recent documentaries that expose the myths set forth in the 911 Commission Report even further, this is a must see. As is stated in the beginning of the film, denial is a common response so I suggest viewing with an open mind. Other documentaries on the subject include: Loose Change (also 2nd Edition and Final Cut) 911 Mysteries (Part 1, Demolition) Other parts pending.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4a833cba7f232d67bab641a85bd2a6d005d566b","amp;dn":"911+In+Plane+Site+%28diector%5C%27s+cut%29+%2B+Bonus.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4a833cba7f232d67bab641a85bd2a6d005d566b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,168,51,203,167,242,50,214,123,171,100,26,133,189,42,109,0,93,86,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
