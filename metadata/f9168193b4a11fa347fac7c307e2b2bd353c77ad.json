As he learns his way through the town-like prison, he meets a 10 year old boy who is special because he has a rare blood type and a Mexican crime boss in the same prison needs his liver. It is up to the titular gringo to save the boy's life and break out of prison.\n\nIncludes:\nGet.the.Gringo.2012.720p.BluRay.x264.MIKY 1.27gb\nGet.the.Gringo.2012.720p.BluRay.x264.MIKY.Sample 5.87mb\nGet.The.Gringo.2012.720p.BluRay.x264.MIKY.srt (If using VLC Media Player, Right Click, Subtitle, Track 1 English.

There are also English parts that are hard to understand because of Spanish accents.)\nGet the Gringo.jpg\n\nMediainfo:\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFile size                                : 1.27 GiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 35mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 895 Kbps\nWriting application                      : HandBrake 0.9.6\n\nVideo\nDuration                                 : 1h 35mn\nBit rate                                 : 1 409 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 534 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 2.40:1\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio\nDuration                                 : 1h 35mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 6 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy, please seed, and comment!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9168193b4a11fa347fac7c307e2b2bd353c77ad","amp;dn":"Get.the.Gringo.2012.720p.BluRay.x264.MIKY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9168193b4a11fa347fac7c307e2b2bd353c77ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,22,129,147,180,161,31,163,71,250,199,195,7,226,178,189,53,60,119,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
