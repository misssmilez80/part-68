He was part of the burgeoning Athens, Georgia music scene in the early and mid-1980s before gaining commercial success during the early 1990s. He continues to release albums and tour.\n\nAs a teenager in Lincoln, Sweet wrote and recorded songs on four-track cassettes, and in the ninth grade joined the band the Specs which resulted in his first recording on a battle of the bands LP produced by a local radio station. Sweet set off to Athens, Georgia in the early '80s after graduating from Lincoln Southeast High School in 1983 to attend college and join the vibrant Athens music scene, most famous as the home base for R.E.M. and The B-52's. In 1983, Sweet collaborated with R.E.M. member Michael Stipe under the name Community Trolls as well as being in Stipe's sister Lynda Stipe's band Oh-OK, and that year also formed the power-pop duo, The Buzz of Delight with drummer David Pierce (Oh-Ok). They released an EP Sound Castles on DB Recs later that year.\n\nIn 1985, he was signed to a solo recording contract with Columbia Records. One album, Inside, was released by Columbia in 1986 to good reviews, but limited success.\n\nSweet was then picked up by A&amp;M Records where he released his second album, Earth (1989), again without commercial success. This period marked a personal and professional low point for Sweet, as A&amp;M lost interest and his marriage failed.\n\nSweet quickly recovered and formed a new band including Richard Lloyd, Robert Quine, Greg Leisz, Lloyd Cole, and Fred Maher. The new group spent 1990 assembling Sweet's next work, originally titled Nothing Lasts.\n\nIn 1990, A&amp;M released Sweet from his contract, and he signed with rival Zoo Entertainment. The album, still under construction at the time, was retitled Girlfriend and released in October 1991. This album featured a classic set of pop-rock songs, was considered by many to be an artistic breakthrough, and quickly garnered impressive U.S. sales (spawning a Top 10 single with the title track). The video for the title track was aired on MTV, MuchMusic and Night Tracks and features Japanese animation, of which Sweet is a fan. The animated clips in the video for &quot;Girlfriend&quot; are taken from the movie Space Adventure Cobra, and the video for &quot;I've Been Waiting&quot; uses clips of the Urusei Yatsura character Lum Invader, of whom Sweet has a tattoo.\n\nSweet's follow-up album, 1993's Altered Beast, was a more diverse and less immediately accessible album than Girlfriend; the album divided fans and critics who had mixed reactions to emotionally intense and brooding tracks like &quot;Someone to Pull the Trigger&quot; and &quot;Knowing People.&quot; A second single, &quot;Time Capsule&quot;, became a music video classic directed by Douglas Gayeton. The highly conceptual work featured extreme closeups of Sweet singing while supine on the grass. As he performed, his body was slowly covered with cockroaches that ultimately wrapped his body with twine. The final shot showed him pinned to the ground in a literary homage to Jonathan Swift's &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;.\n\nIn 1995, Sweet released 100% Fun. The album mixed bouncy pop style with darker lyrics, including a leadoff track, the self-deprecating &quot;Sick of Myself.&quot;\n\nSweet would issue a few more albums in the second half of the 1990s and maintain a devoted core audience, but received little critical acclaim or chart success.\n\nSweet's international success has been somewhat limited by his fear of flying;[1] however he gained a significant following in Japan and his 2003 album Kimi Ga Suki * Raifu, was initially a Japan-only release.\n\nIn early 2002, he formed the supergroup The Thorns with Shawn Mullins and Pete Droge. He released a new album of solo material, Living Things in late 2004, though the material on the album was recorded in 2002.\n\nIn April 2006 he partnered with Bangles rhythm guitarist-vocalist Susanna Hoffs to release a collection of 1960's classics, titled Under the Covers, Vol. 1 featuring their take on such widely known '60s hits as &quot;Monday, Monday&quot; and &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;. The album represented a return to the accessible and melodic approach associated with Sweet's early breakthroughs.\n\nSweet's album, Sunshine Lies, was released on Shout! Factory on August 26, 2008. Accompanying the CD and download formats of the album is a 2-LP set featuring four previously unreleased songs.[2]\n\nOn July 21, 2009, Sweet and Susanna Hoffs released their second collaboration Under the Covers, Vol. 2, which features covers of songs from the 1970s by such artists as Fleetwood Mac, Carly Simon, Yes, Todd Rundgren, and Rod Stewart.\n\nIn April, 2010, the Berkeley Repertory Theatre staged the world premiere of the musical play &quot;Girlfriend,&quot; which used songs from Sweet's album of the same name, crediting Sweet with music and lyrics. The title of the play is ironic because its two characters are gay boys in their late teens.[3][4]\n\nSweet has recently completed work on an album titled Modern Art (currently scheduled for a September 27th, 2011 release). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGirlfriend/Goodfriend 1991 (Reissued 2006)\n\n\nGirlfriend is the third album by Matthew Sweet, his most commercially and critically successful album to date. AV Club has referred to it as Sweet's magnum opus and labeled it the best power pop album of the 1990s.[1] Sweet was joined in the studio by Lloyd Cole, Robert Quine, and Richard Lloyd, all musicians with whom he had worked previously.\n\nSweet recorded the album after his divorce and later said to Rolling Stone, &quot;It's funny how the album ended up showing everything I needed to feel. Everything I needed as an antidote is there.&quot;[6] He told Entertainment Weekly, &quot;People say, 'This is your big breakup record - will you still be able to write good songs?' I'm sure I'll be just as depressed at some other point in my life.&quot;[7]\n\nThe album peaked at 100 on the Billboard 200 album chart.[8] The title track, fueled by its anime-themed video, hit number 4 on the Modern Rock chart and 10 on the Mainstream Rock chart. &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; hit 23 on the Modern Rock chart.[9]\n\nThe cover features a photograph of actress Tuesday Weld from the late 1950s.[10] Originally called Nothing Lasts[10], the album was retitled following objections to the title from Weld.\n\nThe anime clips in the video for &quot;Girlfriend&quot; are taken from the movie Space Adventure Cobra and the clips in the video for &quot;I've Been Waiting&quot; are of the Urusei Yatsura character Lum Invader. &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic parodied the use of animation on his television special Al TV by adding clips of Ren and Stimpy, Bugs Bunny, Betty Boop, and Rocky and Bullwinkle.\n\n&quot;Girlfriend&quot; is featured in Crossroads. Cover version of &quot;Girlfriend&quot; is featured in Guitar Hero II. Cover version of &quot;Girlfriend&quot; is downloadable content for Guitar Hero III Mobile.\n\nIn 2006, the album was remastered and released under the &quot;Legacy Edition&quot; label[11], with three bonus tracks (originally released on the &quot;Girlfriend&quot; single, subtitled &quot;the superdeformed CD&quot;, and also available on the Japanese version of the album), plus a second disk of home demos, live versions and session recordings called Goodfriend. Subtitled &quot;Another Take On 'Girlfriend'&quot;, Goodfriend was a promotional CD partly distributed through Sweet's fan club, and was not commercially released until the Legacy Edition.[12] 'Goodfriend' was the original name of the title track. But after early listeners universally misheard the lyric, Sweet changed the title to 'Girlfriend.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n\n\nDisc 1 - Girlfriend\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Divine Intervention&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37\n2.\t&quot;I've Been Waiting&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n3.\t&quot;Girlfriend&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n4.\t&quot;Looking at the Sun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n5.\t&quot;Winona&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:59 (a song named after but not about Winona Ryder[10])\n6.\t&quot;Evangeline&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45 (sung from the point of view of Johnny Six from the comic book Evangeline)\n7.\t&quot;Day for Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n8.\t&quot;Thought I Knew You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:57\n9.\t&quot;You Don't Love Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n10.\t&quot;I Wanted to Tell You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n11.\t&quot;Don't Go&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n12.\t&quot;Your Sweet Voice&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n13.\t&quot;Does She Talk?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n14.\t&quot;Holy War&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n15.\t&quot;Nothing Lasts&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n16.\t&quot;Good Friend&quot; (demo) - 3:36\n17.\t&quot;Superdeformed&quot; (demo) - 4:09\n18.\t&quot;Teenage Female&quot; (demo) - 3:54\n\n\n\nThe three demo tracks appear only as bonus tracks from the 2006 Legacy Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 2 - Goodfriend \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Divine Intervention&quot; (acoustic) - 3:05\n2.\t&quot;Girlfriend&quot; - 2:52\n3.\t&quot;Day for Night&quot; (live) - 3:21\n4.\t&quot;Thought I Knew You&quot; (live) - 3:57\n5.\t&quot;Looking at the Sun&quot; (acoustic) - 4:15\n6.\t&quot;Does She Talk&quot; (live) - 4:23\n7.\t&quot;You Don't Love Me&quot; (live) - 6:47\n8.\t&quot;Someone to Pull the Trigger&quot; - 3:53\n9.\t&quot;I've Been Waiting&quot; (live) - 3:45\n10.\t&quot;Winona&quot; (acoustic) - 4:30\n11.\t&quot;Girlfriend&quot; (live) - 4:05\n12.\t&quot;Cortez the Killer&quot; (Neil Young) (live) - 6:28\n13.\t&quot;Isolation&quot; (John Lennon) (acoustic) - 3:01\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c666b871a0d0087509d6937f373b460d6f0ad8d9","amp;dn":"Matthew+Sweet+-+Girlfriend%3B+Goodfriend+1991+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c666b871a0d0087509d6937f373b460d6f0ad8d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,102,184,113,160,208,8,117,9,214,147,127,55,59,70,13,111,10,216,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
