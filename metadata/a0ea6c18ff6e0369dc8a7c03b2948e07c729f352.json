Ellington's percussive style always sounded modern and he comes up with consistently strong solos on such numbers as &quot;Love You Madly,&quot; &quot;The Hawk Talks&quot; and especially &quot;Cotton Tail,&quot; easily keeping up with his younger sidemen. Highly recommended. \n\nRecorded January 8th 1973.\n\n01. Cotton Tail  \n02. The Blues \n03. The Hawk Talks   \n04. Prelude To A Kiss  \n05. Love You Madly   \n06. Just Squeeze Me  \n07. Everything But You\n\n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0ea6c18ff6e0369dc8a7c03b2948e07c729f352","amp;dn":"Duke+Ellington+-+Dukes+Big+Four+%28XRCD%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0ea6c18ff6e0369dc8a7c03b2948e07c729f352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,234,108,24,255,110,3,105,220,138,124,3,178,148,142,7,199,41,243,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
