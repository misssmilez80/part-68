Pratchett's first novel, The Carpet People, was published in 1971, and since his first Discworld novel (The Colour of Magic) was published in 1983, he has written two books a year on average.\n\nPratchett was the UK's best-selling author of the 1990s, and as of August 2010 had sold over 65 million books worldwide in thirty-seven languages. He is currently the second most-read writer in the UK, and seventh most-read non-US author in the US.\n\nTITLE: Snuff\nSERIES: Discworld\nFORMATS: EPUB,MOBI,LIT,PDF\n\nBook Description\n\nFor nearly three decades, Terry Pratchett has enthralled millions of fans worldwide with his irreverent, wonderfully funny satires set in the fabulously imaginative Discworld, a universe remarkably similar to our own. From sports to religion, politics to education, science to capitalism, and everything in between, Pratchett has skewered sacred cows with both laughter and wisdom, and exposed our warts, foibles, and eccentricities in a unique, entertaining, and ultimately serious way.\n\nAt long last, Lady Sybil has lured her husband, Sam Vimes, on a well-deserved holiday away from the crime and grime of Ankh-Morpork. But for the commander of the City Watch, a vacation in the country is anything but relaxing. The balls, the teas, the muckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not to mention all that fresh air and birdsongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are more than a bit taxing on a cynical city-born and -bred copper.\n\nYet a policeman will find a crime anywhere if he decides to look hard enough, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not long before a body is discovered, and SamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½out of his jurisdiction, out of his element, and out of bacon sandwiches (thanks to his well-meaning wife)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½must rely on his instincts, guile, and street smarts to see justice done. As he sets off on the chase, though, he must remember to watch where he steps. . . . This is the countryside, after all, and the streets most definitely are not paved with gold.
