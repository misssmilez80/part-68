Arrogant and vengeful, Fang is\njoined in his quest by a cowardly golem prince, a shy\nmedusa priestess, a young phoenix clan maiden, and many\nother mythical beings seeking to meet with the goddess.  \n\nDue to the collaborative nature of the game's design,  \neach of the 13 main characters was created by a different\nartist. The main character Fang was designed by Pako,    \nmost famous for his work on the Shining Force series,  \nwhile other characters were fashioned by artists such as  \nToshiyuki Kubooka (Lunar), Shinichiro Otsuka (Summon        \nNight), and Kazushi Hagiwara (Bastard!!), to name a few.    \nAs such, each character has its own distinct and  \nsignature style.                                        \n\nIn Unchained Blades, players journey through the game\nwith a party of up to four characters, moving through    \ndungeons in a first-person perspective and engaging in  \nturn-based combat along the way. Using the game's unique\n&quot;Unchain&quot; system while in battle, players are able to try  \nand convince monsters to follow them. If they are    \nsuccessful in using the Unchain system, the enemy monster  \nwill then join their party and help them in the future by\nblocking attacks or supplying players with special    \noffensive abilities. Each character in the player's four    \nperson party can hold up to four &quot;followers&quot;, ensuring  \nplenty of combat variety. The game has also been    \ncompletely redubbed with new English voice-overs and    \nboasts over 60 hours of gameplay.                  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.xseedgames.com/news.php?id=149&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.xseedgames.com/news.php?id=149&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c5093bf64d5f7c9a07a4e93e3f50cb6c34742c","amp;dn":"Unchained_Blades_USA_PSN_PSP-PLAYASiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c5093bf64d5f7c9a07a4e93e3f50cb6c34742c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,197,9,59,246,77,95,124,154,7,164,233,62,63,80,203,108,52,116,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
