Others say the Decision series. This version calls it &quot;Barbara Stanwyck Presents&quot; , maybe because she hosts this episode. Whatever the series, it was also an anthology with different guests each week and it was filmed in 1958.\n\nGuest Stars --- Barbara Stanwyck, Jeff Morrow, and Trevor Bardette.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:065c3a9c6910bec3e6b70289dec5255163d643a0","amp;dn":"DECISION+--+Sudden+SIlence+%28+guest+star+Barbara+Stanwyck+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"065c3a9c6910bec3e6b70289dec5255163d643a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,92,58,156,105,16,190,195,230,183,2,137,222,197,37,81,99,214,67,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
