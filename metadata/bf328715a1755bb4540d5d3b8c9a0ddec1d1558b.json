The team are called in to\n                investigate the death of prominent human rights\n                lawyer Richard Warner. He died in a fire at his home\n                but it is not clear if the fire was set deliberately,\n                so the team analyse the severely burned body without\n                knowing the cause of the fire. Warner had recently\n                been visited by one of his old clients - Joseph\n                Marial, an asylum seeker from Sudan, who had been\n                deported a year earlier after he was found guilty of\n                assault. Warner defended him, but was unable to get\n                him acquitted. Warner's son, Nick, is convinced that\n                Joseph must be responsible, but there appears to be\n                no proof. In a race against time, Oggy, Mike and the\n                team reconstruct the fire in their lab to try and\n                establish more information about the fire that killed\n                Warner. Their findings bring fresh evidence to light.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf328715a1755bb4540d5d3b8c9a0ddec1d1558b","amp;dn":"The.Body.Farm.S01E05.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf328715a1755bb4540d5d3b8c9a0ddec1d1558b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,50,135,21,161,117,91,180,84,13,93,59,140,154,13,222,193,209,85,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
