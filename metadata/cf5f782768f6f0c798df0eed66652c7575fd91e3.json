Times have changed markedly since the 1980s, when the struggle was dedicated to overthrowing the elected government of the day.\n\nFierce supporters of the present Marxist revolution, the Tupas now count among their enemies Colombian paramilitaries and narco gangs, both of whom destabilize society and thus the revolutionary process. But with a dwindling membership that is far from battle-ready, how serious are Mao and Chino about playing a significant role within their limited territory, let alone the rest of the sprawling capital city?\n\nThis film depicts the spectrum of problematic issues in Venezuela, ranging from police corruption and the narcotics trade, to political division and foreign intervention. Chino and Mao speak at length alongside drug dealers, ex-politicians, journalists, and a U.S. expert.\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/fpnzU.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf5f782768f6f0c798df0eed66652c7575fd91e3","amp;dn":"TUPAMARO%3A+Venezuelan+Guerrillas+%5B2011+Documentary%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf5f782768f6f0c798df0eed66652c7575fd91e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,95,120,39,104,246,240,199,152,223,14,237,102,101,44,117,117,253,145,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
