The book begins with an extensive introduction to helioseismology. The solar cycle and gravity modes are discussed before the focus is widened from helioseismology to asteroseismology which is detailed in a series of specific chapters. Based on courses given at a graduate school, these tutorial lecture notes will be of interest and useful to a rather broad audience of scientists and students.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 359 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (July 8, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3642199275\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642199271","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:049968bb109970ccc929c9768e4f7222fb7fc227","amp;dn":"The+Pulsations+of+the+Sun+and+the+Stars+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"049968bb109970ccc929c9768e4f7222fb7fc227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,153,104,187,16,153,112,204,201,41,201,118,142,79,114,34,251,127,194,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
