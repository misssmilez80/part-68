Paterson and Jeff Stockwell. The film is based on the Katherine Paterson novel of the same name, and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures in the US. The film stars Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb, Robert Patrick, Bailee Madison and Zooey Deschanel. Bridge to Terabithia tells the story of Jess Aarons and Leslie Burke, ten-year-old neighbors who create a fantasy world called Terabithia and spend their free time together in an abandoned tree house.\n\nScreenwriter David Paterson is Katherine Paterson's son, and the novel is based on parts of his childhood. When he asked his mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed because of his ability as a playwright. Production began in February 2006, and the film was finished by November. Principal photography was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took several months.\n\nBridge to Terabithia was released theatrically in the U.S. and Canada on February 16, 2007. The film was a financial success, and with a budget of around $20 million, it had a worldwide gross of US$137 million. The film received positive reviews; critics called it a faithful adaption of the children's novel, and found dynamic visuals and natural performances further enhanced the imaginative film. Bridge to Terabithia was nominated for seven awards, winning five at the Young Artist Awards.\n\n\nScreen-shots :-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/9f9fa7150379653&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/9f9fa7150379653&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/0920bc150379675&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/0920bc150379675&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/49c941150379696&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/49c941150379696&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/55409d150379714&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/55409d150379714&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/3f363e150379734&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/3f363e150379734&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/e3c3f2150379746&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/e3c3f2150379746&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n************************SEED AND ENJOY***************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9af4163576b67b55ad6c3092eb40873e6a91ff1","amp;dn":"Bridge+to+Terabithia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9af4163576b67b55ad6c3092eb40873e6a91ff1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,175,65,99,87,107,103,181,90,214,195,9,46,180,8,115,230,169,31,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
