I have repacked Silentscape Studios\\' Silent Hill 1, giving it a normal installation (I heard people had troubles with the original, and original wasn\\'t the latest version, so they had to look for the patch).\n\nAnyway. Here you get a complete, repacked Silent Hill 1 for PC, which works under Windows XP/Vista/7 (I tested), AND I wrote a trainer for the game, which gives you invulnerability and infinite ammo for all guns (tested under XP/VIsta/7 too, but you might need to disable UAC, because it blocks hotkeys sometimes).\n\n\nThe installation:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAkpPaADI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAkpPaADI&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAKPcaadi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAKPcaadi&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe trainer:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HaKpmAAdI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HaKpmAAdI&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n\nP.S. I actually write other trainers for games that have no cheats under the nickname \\&quot;SingleRose\\&quot; (that was inspired by my friend, she loves roses :P), and by now I have 20 trainers total. All are unique in the sense that I wrote them for games that have no (working) cheats. I\\'ll be making a public release some time in the future.\n\n------------------------------\n\nP.P.S. I DO NOT want to hear that something is not working. I test all my stuff on multiple computers and several editions of Windows, *everything* works fine. If something is not working, the problem is on your side.\n\n*sigh* still, report the problems. I\\'m here to help, as usual. I just hope it\\'s gonna be something geniune, not \\&quot;I forgot to install DirectX\\&quot; type of comments, like it\\'s been with my repack of New Vegas.\n\n\nMy policy, however, stays the same: if you don\\'t have the basic know-how or (basic) skills to make pirated stuff work on your system, BUY games.\n\n\n\nCredit foir original game (emulated) release goes to Silentscape Studios, obviously. Great release.\n\n\n\nAnd the usual warning: if you detect any viruses in my releases, throw your anti-virus out of the window and get a normal one.\n\n\n\nI would also like to ask you not to reupload my trainer to other sources (yet) because im planning to make a public release with at least 20 trainers at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n-illiria","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f468f96967cdad0e68439fed373e0f4df94d66e5","amp;dn":"Silent+Hill+1+%28PC%2C+ver.+1.2.1+REPACKED%29+%2B+Trainer%21+-illiria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f468f96967cdad0e68439fed373e0f4df94d66e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,104,249,105,103,205,173,14,104,67,159,237,55,62,15,77,249,77,102,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
