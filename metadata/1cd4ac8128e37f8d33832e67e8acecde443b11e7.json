Download RunAsDate from my torrent or from CNET.\n2. And then install a new 30 day trial copy of Stardock Deskscape 3.\n3. And then run the RunAsDate and Browse to the Stardock Deskscape 3 shortcut or launcher.\n4. And then set the Date and Time to Current time or Yesterdays time (but won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work for dates before yesterday).\n5. Unmark the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;move the time forward according to the real time\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;.\n6. Mark the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Immediate Mode - Change the date immediately when the program starts.\n7. Create Desktop shortcut, if you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t create a desktop shortcut...the original Stardock deskscape shortcut/application launcher will still be on its active trial.\n8. Once you have created the new shortcut, for my case i named my shortcut \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Stardock Deskscape 3 cracked\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. Once you have created the new shortcut, delete the old shortcut of Stardock Deskscape 3 because that one is the uncracked one.\n\n9. Run Deskscapes 3.\n\n10. Done!\n\n11.

That is false because i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve tried it and it doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work!\nIf your trial has expired...i can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t help you much with that because the only way to get that 30 trial back is by flashing the computer with factory settings and erasing everything back to factory settings (which isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t what you want).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cd4ac8128e37f8d33832e67e8acecde443b11e7","amp;dn":"Stardock+Deskscape+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cd4ac8128e37f8d33832e67e8acecde443b11e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,212,172,129,40,227,127,141,51,131,46,103,232,172,236,222,68,59,17,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
