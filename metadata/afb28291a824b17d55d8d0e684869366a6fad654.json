She even has a cosmetics range named after her. Her fourth album is an exquisite piece of chamber folk, setting her lark-like tones to cascading piano, solemn viola and chiming handbells along with accordion and hurdy gurdy. It's low on surprises (no BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk cover this time) but stalwarts such as &quot;Sweet Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Brigg Fair&quot; emerge refreshed, and the contrast between its sometimes dark themes (misfortune, mortality, murder) and the stateliness of its music makes for an atmosphere of rare enchantment.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/10/26/jackie-oates/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/10/26/jackie-oates/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afb28291a824b17d55d8d0e684869366a6fad654","amp;dn":"Jackie+Oates...Saturnine%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afb28291a824b17d55d8d0e684869366a6fad654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,178,130,145,168,36,177,125,85,216,208,230,132,134,147,102,166,250,214,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
