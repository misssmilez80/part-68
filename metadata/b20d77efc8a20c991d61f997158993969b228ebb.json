As in many small, and somewhat isolated towns, people often find very little to do after school or when not working. GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤llivare, being based on the mining industry, have for many kids growing up, given natural influences and understanding of machines. With some of the highest peaks in Scandinavia at your doorstep, and very long winters with lots of snow, this was a perfect framing for the beginning of freeride snowmobiling. As the years passed, the Ruff Riders have evolved to the biggest influence in Scandinavia regarding freeriding and freestyle snowmobiling. During the summer these guys often find themselves doing other stunts and extremesport activites, which has always been an influence in the Ruff Riders spirit. As new riders joined the pack, motocross and other extreme sports have gotten to know about the Ruff Riders aswell. Today Ruff Riders crew extends to riders all over Sweden, and even a few Americans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b20d77efc8a20c991d61f997158993969b228ebb","amp;dn":"Ruff+Riders+6+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b20d77efc8a20c991d61f997158993969b228ebb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,13,119,239,200,162,12,153,29,97,249,151,21,137,147,150,155,34,142,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
