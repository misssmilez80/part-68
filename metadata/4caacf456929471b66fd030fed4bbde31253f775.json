The fast, white waters make it the perfect training ground     \n  for the RNLI's international flood rescue team, as Matt finds out     \n  when he joins their ranks for the day. Meanwhile, Ellie discovers     \n  how a fluke of nature has brought local mussel farms to the brink of  \n  collapse and explores the industrial heritage behind one of           \n  Scotland's most beautiful landscapes. And with more and more of us    \n  choosing to holiday in Britain, John Craven investigates the impact   \n  of the &quot;staycation&quot; on our countryside. Down on the farm, harvest is  \n  nearing its end - but has it proved fruitful for Adam?
