Are human beings superior to other animals, or is this just a human prejudice? Does Darwin have implications for heated issues like euthanasia and animal rights? Does evolution tell us the purpose of life, or does it imply that life has no ultimate purpose? Does evolution tell us what is morally right and wrong, or does it imply that ultimately nothing is right or wrong? In this fascinating and intriguing book, Steve Stewart-Williams addresses these and other fundamental philosophical questions raised by evolutionary theory and the exciting new field of evolutionary psychology. Drawing on biology, psychology and philosophy, he argues that Darwinian science supports a view of a godless universe devoid of ultimate purpose or moral structure, but that we can still live a good life and a happy life within the confines of this view.\n\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press\nNumber Of Pages: 352\nPublication Date: 2010-12-31 \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19b837d60a5f85a76702d6128ae0133b98cdb3f1","amp;dn":"Darwin%2C+God+and+the+Meaning+of+Life+-+Steve+Stewart-Williams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19b837d60a5f85a76702d6128ae0133b98cdb3f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,184,55,214,10,95,133,167,103,2,214,18,138,224,19,59,152,205,179,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
