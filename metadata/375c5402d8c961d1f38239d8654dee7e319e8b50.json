After his release from prison, Vishwanath decides to seek vengeance, but finds out that it is virtually impossible to do this through due process of law. So he decides to change his identity, hire a gang of crooks and assassins, to carry out his vendetta. Not realizing that in doing this he is alienating himself from the love of his life, Soni; and making himself a wanted man by the police, leaving his crippled sister, Munni and mom, Shanti to fend for themselves, and at the mercy of GNK and his associates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:375c5402d8c961d1f38239d8654dee7e319e8b50","amp;dn":"Vishwanath+1978+classic+movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"375c5402d8c961d1f38239d8654dee7e319e8b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,92,84,2,216,201,97,209,243,130,57,216,101,77,238,126,49,158,139,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
