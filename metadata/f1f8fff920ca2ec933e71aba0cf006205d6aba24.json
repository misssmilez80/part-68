After ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInnocence LostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ split Jamie was asked to play 5 live shows with the Pogues filling in for the sick Phil Chevron, 5 gigs turned to 5 years. Jamie was also involved in the songwriting (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Sun And The MoonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) for the last Pogues album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPogue MahoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. After the Pogues, Jamie moved to Germany and hooked up with Padja Zaric, the highly regarded Bosnian high-speed accordion player and formed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPerfectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSickly men of thirty or soÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the third full length from the band (and the first with drummer Andreas Schabinger) and what a widely diverse album it is, Punk, Folk, Country, Garage and classic British Pop influences from the 60ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and 80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. For the most part Jamie seems to have moved back to his 80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s roots. The music is acoustic based (but not always) Beatles influenced British pop mixed with a heavy doses of PadjaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s accordion that gives ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPerfectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very distinctive identity.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAdorableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the best song, classic British Pop, a hit single if there was any justice (or taste) left in the world. Pogues fan should check out the cover of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Fought the LawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the accordion makes it much more Joe Strummer with the Pogues then the Clash. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSheer PerfectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOh ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMoving UpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and especially ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeart Shaped SunglassesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (co written with Spider Stacy and James McNally) are all highlights.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1f8fff920ca2ec933e71aba0cf006205d6aba24","amp;dn":"Perfect+-+1999+-+Sickly+Men+of+Thirty+or+So","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1f8fff920ca2ec933e71aba0cf006205d6aba24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,248,255,249,32,202,46,201,51,231,26,186,12,240,6,32,93,106,186,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
