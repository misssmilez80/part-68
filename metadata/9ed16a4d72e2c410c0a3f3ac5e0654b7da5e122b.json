The series follows Dusk, Ricochet, Hornet and Prodigy.  Prodigy is recognizable from the Avengers: Initiave series as well as being a major character in Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt.  The rest of the characters have mostly disappeared although according to wikipedia Richochet has appeared in Runaways (Is that series still ongoing? Anyone know?)\nAll thanks to the original scanners and uploaders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ed16a4d72e2c410c0a3f3ac5e0654b7da5e122b","amp;dn":"Slingers+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ed16a4d72e2c410c0a3f3ac5e0654b7da5e122b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,209,106,77,114,226,196,16,192,163,243,172,94,6,84,183,218,94,18,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
