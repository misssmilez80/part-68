Open Lines\n\nPrager H3... As usual, Dennis takes calls from listeners. Topics covered include; why isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Dennis more aggressive \n in attacking liberal arguments, what is DennisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ favorite language, does Dennis have any idiosyncrasies, \n does the SCOTUS decision fall under the law of unintended consequences, and what does Dennis think about the term\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“Compassionate Conservative?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nPrager 20120629 .. Happiness is Earned\n\nPrager H2... Dennis talks about how being given things in life does not bring happiness... \n happiness comes when one wprks hard and succeeds.\n\n\nPrager 20120629 ... 1 Roberts Review\n\nPrager H1... Dennis talks to Congressman David Dreier, Chairman of the House Rules Committee about the Roberts ruling on\n ObamaCareÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Why do Democrats keep saying that Republicans donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a health care reform plan when they obviously do?\n The question should be, who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a plan?.. \n Why did Roberts rule the way he did? He wanted to protect the integrity of the court. \n But that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make his decision correct.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f446fb1a6f552f6738a7f893373c56005d0828ec","amp;dn":"The+Dennis+Prager+Radio+Show+JUN-29-2012+FRI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f446fb1a6f552f6738a7f893373c56005d0828ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,70,251,26,111,85,47,103,56,167,248,147,55,60,86,0,93,8,40,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
