This is a standalone clean install.\n## At least have 10.589.22577 installed.\n\nMount image in UltraIso or DaemonTools, installed via AltiumInstaller.exe, replace dxp.exe, edit AD10.700.ini\nto the instructions in russian (or see previous release CRACK_EN.txt, run the (russian software) from left to rigt. \n\nThe three buttons is &quot;Read AD10.INI&quot;, &quot;Create ALF license file&quot; and &quot;Exit&quot;...\n\nWhereas previously there were previous versions use AltiumUninstaller.exe, just might have to hand delete the file \n\nC:\\Users\\User_Name\\AppData\\Local\\Altium\\AltiumInstaller.ini - in Win7.\n\nIn WinXP you must remove the same file AltiumInstaller.ini, location of a similar, but for XP - a descent can not \n\nremember, use the search file.

His help is fantastic. \n\nWhy don't you help out more? Ask yourself!\n\n//Longword","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ee4d072c987872b5ee418e67af78168ad329948","amp;dn":"Altium_Designer_10.700.22943.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ee4d072c987872b5ee418e67af78168ad329948","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,228,208,114,201,135,135,43,94,228,24,230,122,247,129,104,173,50,153,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
