Live at the Paramount Theatre \n  is the only known Nirvana LIVE show recorded on 16mm film, and has never \n  been released before now. Recorded at the height of the hype surrounding \n  'Nevermind' in 1991, this worldwide cinema premiere will take place exactly \n  20 years to the day since its release.\n  \n  'Nevermind' elevated Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl from \n  critically-acclaimed Aberdeen, Washington cult band to generational \n  spokesmen, who had unwittingly created a cultural shift and musical \n  touchstone. Rising to the top of the charts the world over by years end, \n  and ultimately selling over 30 million copies worldwide, 'Nevermind' would \n  come to be much more than one of the most successful and influential albums \n  of its and any era.\n  \n  This event will be the first and only chance to experience the concert on \n  the big screen. Each ticket includes a redeemable voucher (given to patrons \n  on the night) for the 20th Anniversary 2CD Deluxe Edition of 'Nevermind',  \n  featuring 40 tracks including rarities, studio outtakes, and live tracks.\n  \n  Hosted by Richard Kingsmill, and proudly supported by triple j and Street \n  Press Australia.\n  \n  'Nevermind' is 20.\n                                                                               \n                                                                             \n                             Enjoy ;)                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n                                                                   \n                                                                  \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                               \n                                          \n                                                 \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                 group info                                         \n                                                                       \n                               Know Your Role and Shut Your Mouth!             \n                                                                               \n                      we are now looking for...                          \n                                                                  \n                   nothing. unless you're good. then find us.      \n                                                                  \n                                                \n                                               \n                                                 \n                                                     \n                                            \n                                                \n                                              \n       KYR respects...                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                   \n       everyone keeping it real and oldschool.                \n                                                             \n                     we love ya!                             \n                                                             \n                             \n                                                 \n      h8!HiGHONASCii                         k N O W  y O U R  r O L E","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb1873dd8e26996646aa9d0de85ad069326d115a","amp;dn":"Nirvana.Live.At.The.Paramount.HDTV.XviD-KYR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb1873dd8e26996646aa9d0de85ad069326d115a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,24,115,221,142,38,153,102,70,170,157,13,232,90,208,105,50,109,17,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
