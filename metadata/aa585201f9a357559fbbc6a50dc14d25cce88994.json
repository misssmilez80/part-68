Across the capital, west London neighbours Fulham and Queens Park Rangers \nmeet in the top flight surprisingly for the first time, while Chelsea travel north to Bolton and new \nboys Swansea entertain Stoke. As always, there is a review of the best of the action from Saturday's \ngames with opinion and analysis from MOTD2 regular Lee Dixon.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa585201f9a357559fbbc6a50dc14d25cce88994","amp;dn":"Match+Of+The+Day+-+2+-+2nd+October+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa585201f9a357559fbbc6a50dc14d25cce88994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,88,82,1,249,163,87,85,159,187,198,165,13,193,77,37,204,232,137,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
