Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:258767046b7eb0438ada6370453acf22e4884c24","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+12+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"258767046b7eb0438ada6370453acf22e4884c24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,135,103,4,107,126,176,67,138,218,99,112,69,58,207,34,228,136,76,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
