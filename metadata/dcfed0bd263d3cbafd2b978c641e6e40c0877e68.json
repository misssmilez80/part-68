It teaches that religion is 'poison', the future of society depends on its removal, science replaces it, and atheism leads to a better life. The proponents of the new atheism are evangelistic, clever and energetic, attracting worldwide publicity and enormous funding. What do Christians need to know about this growing movement?\n\nThis DVD records a special seminar featuring Professor John Lennox (University of Oxford), John Dickson and Greg Clarke (Centre for Public Christianity in Sydney) explaining the new atheism and how Christians can respond to it graciously and effectively.\n\nThree engaging talks on the following topics:\n\n* What is the New Atheism? (Greg Clarke)\n* The New Atheists on Jesus (John Dickson)\n* Has Science buried God? (John Lennox)\n\nBuy: http://publicchristianity.org/store/product/the-new-atheism-taking-it-seriously\n\n\nEnjoyand Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcfed0bd263d3cbafd2b978c641e6e40c0877e68","amp;dn":"The+New+Atheism+-+Taking+It+Seriously","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcfed0bd263d3cbafd2b978c641e6e40c0877e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,254,208,189,38,61,60,186,253,43,151,140,100,30,110,64,192,135,126,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
