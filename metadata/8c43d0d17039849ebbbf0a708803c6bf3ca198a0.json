Also I'm not sure if this'll work for some people but in case it doesn't, Here are some information you might want.\n\nJava 7 (86x) located in C:Program Files (x86)Javajre7binjava.exe\nWindows 7 64-Bit\n\nOnce you've extracted all the files inside the zip file into a folder, Run ProjectZomboid Experimental Optimized, It should be a batch file and then you're done. If that doesn't work, I included some more batch files in there, Try them all.\n\nHave fun!\n\nOnce again, These files do not belong to me, I just mashed them together since everyone kept getting problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c43d0d17039849ebbbf0a708803c6bf3ca198a0","amp;dn":"Project+Zomboid+0.2.0q+Fixed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c43d0d17039849ebbbf0a708803c6bf3ca198a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,67,208,209,112,57,132,158,187,191,10,112,136,3,198,191,60,161,152,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
