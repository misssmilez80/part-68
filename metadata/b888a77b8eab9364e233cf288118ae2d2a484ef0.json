As the three women negotiate the dangerous relationships among them, the seven women directors weave a sensual tale of suspense. Drawing inspiration from the poem by Jessica Wilbur and the surrealist parlour game, The Exquisite Corpse, each director selected a word or phrase on which to base her segment, and the seven chapters of the film bear their individual marks. This impressive experiment in filmmaking emerges as a sensitive tale of young desire, loss, and love's confusion.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b888a77b8eab9364e233cf288118ae2d2a484ef0","amp;dn":"Brushfires+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b888a77b8eab9364e233cf288118ae2d2a484ef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,136,167,123,142,171,147,100,226,51,207,40,129,24,174,45,42,72,78,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
