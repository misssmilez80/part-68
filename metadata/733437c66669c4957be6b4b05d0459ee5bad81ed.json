Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:733437c66669c4957be6b4b05d0459ee5bad81ed","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+12+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"733437c66669c4957be6b4b05d0459ee5bad81ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,52,55,198,102,105,196,149,123,230,180,176,93,4,89,238,91,173,129,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
