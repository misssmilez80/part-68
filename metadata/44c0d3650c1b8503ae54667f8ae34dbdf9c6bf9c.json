Oldtimer). I have included the original Adlib RAW and the MP3 formats. To be able to listen to the original songs through your Winamp you need to install the AdPlug, which is also included in the torrent (in_adlib-1.8.2.exe). The MP3 version of the songs are recorded using pseudo-stereo effect of the AdPlug, which makes them sound very awesome. Check it out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44c0d3650c1b8503ae54667f8ae34dbdf9c6bf9c","amp;dn":"Motor+City+%28a.k.a.+Oldtimer%29+soundtrack+songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44c0d3650c1b8503ae54667f8ae34dbdf9c6bf9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,192,211,101,12,27,133,3,174,84,102,127,138,227,77,189,249,198,191,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
