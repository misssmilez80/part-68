Perfect for home and educational use.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://illumenews.tumblr.com/post/12073364346&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://illumenews.tumblr.com/post/12073364346&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSo, you must be pretty adventurous to come over to this page, eh? Well this is like a Chemistry lab, where the wrong mixtures could result to an undesired reaction. I do have to warn you, these ISO images are not for the faint-of-heart. If you screw your hard disk up... well that's 'death' by misadventure.\nTo login to illume OS, the user account name is 'root' while the password is 'pineapple'. If you've installed illume OS to a hard disk, you have the choice of making your own user account under your name and your own password via the Terminal using the command 'adduser'... or to go to the Package Manager and remove a package called 'xdm'.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bede397bc28a8d14e70fa56ccc7c2c056be5c77","amp;dn":"illume-testing-013.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bede397bc28a8d14e70fa56ccc7c2c056be5c77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,237,227,151,188,40,168,209,78,112,250,86,204,199,194,192,86,190,92,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
