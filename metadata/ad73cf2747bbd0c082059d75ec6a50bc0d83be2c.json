The dart is stopped \nwhen it impacts a force field around Kurohagi. He remarks that Kikyo was hired to kill Logan, but with another \nassassin on the payroll, he is abstaining from the job. Hideki unleashes an upgraded version of Vadhaka on Logan \nleading to a fight between the two killing machines. As Logan is taking a beating from a more powerful Vadhaka, \nhe uses all his strength to get out a being crushed by Vadhaka's foot. But with all his effort Logan is still \nlosing and is taking a severe attack by Vadhaka. When Vadhaka rams into Logan, the wall around them collapses. \nKoh and the others meet with Yukio and an angry Kurohagi calls for his robot, Vadhaka. As Kurohagi orders his \nmen to fire on the intruders, Kikyo arrives and disarms them stating that it was dishonorable and he couldn't \nabide it. Logan escapes the rubble and heals his wounds to proceed fighting, but as he does, so does Vadhaka. \nVadhaka moves towards Logan, and smacks Min out of his way. As he is fighting, Kikyo helps even the odds. \nYukio tries to keep Min alive, but dies in her arms saying that Kurohagi must be stopped. \nEnraged, Kikyo uses his WindBlade attack, with no effect. Logan tries to think of a weak point on Vadhaka, \nKikyo in agreement draws a second sword from his other arm to use. Logan grabs a spear previously shot, \nand impales the head of Vadhaka.  \n  \nSpoken Language: English\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nScreens:\n---------\n\n[URL=http://img171.imageshack.us/i/wolverine110shingenojav.jpg/][IMG]http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/8194/wolverine110shingenojav.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 176M\nPlayTime           : 00:19:58.31\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 35905\nVideoBitRate       : 1093256\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFormat: Avi\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nHash:\n------\nAD73CF2747BBD0C082059D75EC6A50BC0D83BE2C\n--------------------------------\n[/center]\n\n\n\nJoin us at #Cartoon_Palace onfor more Cartoons and Anime.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad73cf2747bbd0c082059d75ec6a50bc0d83be2c","amp;dn":"Wolverine+-+110+-+Shingen+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad73cf2747bbd0c082059d75ec6a50bc0d83be2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,115,207,39,71,187,208,192,130,5,157,117,236,106,80,188,13,131,190,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
