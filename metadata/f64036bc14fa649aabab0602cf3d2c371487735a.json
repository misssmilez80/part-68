Together, they create a unique sound--almost genreless at times, but drawing heavily on Rock and Hip Hop influences from the Beatles to Dr Dre. The sound of the band is often compared to Gym Class Heroes, Atmosphere, and Denver's own Flobots. As a rap-rock duo, the two have been creating music together for four years.&quot;\n\n\nAll Is Fair In Love And War (2010)\n\n1. Never Feel The Same\n2. Puppets\n3. Gotta Believe\n4.
