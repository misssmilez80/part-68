Everyone disappears.  Gone.  Everyone except for the young. Teens. Middle schoolers. Toddlers. But not a single adult. No teachers, no cops, no doctors, no parents. Gone, too, are the phones, internet, and television. There is no way to get help.  Hunger threatens. Bullies rule. A sinister creature lurks. Animals are mutating. And the teens themselves are changing, developing new talents--unimaginable, dangerous, deadly powers--that grow stronger by the day.  It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a terrifying new world. Sides are being chosen and war is imminent.  The first in a breathtaking saga about teens battling each other and their darkest selves, gone is a page-turning thriller that will make you look at the world in a whole new way. \n\n\nEPUB and MOBI, Books 1-4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec9ffa34243fc020d9c9ef197849d933ba54f4d2","amp;dn":"%5BEPUB%5D+%5BMOBI%5D+Gone+Series+-+Michael+Grant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec9ffa34243fc020d9c9ef197849d933ba54f4d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,159,250,52,36,63,192,32,217,201,239,25,120,73,217,51,186,84,244,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
