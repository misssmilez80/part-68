IT CAN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY.  NEVER HAS. NEVER WILL. NEVER CAN.  AS LONG AS THERE ARE ONLY COWARDS (EARLY AND LATE MAJORITY) YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT CHANGE, OH, UNLESS YOU MEAN THE $$$CHANGE THAT THE ACTIVIST AUTH-WHORES AND NGOS, NON-PROFITS ORGY IN, KILLING TIME, KILLING OUR GLOBAL NEEDIEST, SIMPLY WOLVES, IN TRUTH.\n\nFor you insanely humane, that will look anywhere and everywhere for Truth to replace the status quo with sanity - study this - ponder deeply.\n\nHey, you wanna believe this applies only to high tech?
