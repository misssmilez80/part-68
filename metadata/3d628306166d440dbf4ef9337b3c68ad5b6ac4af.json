It automatically completes words for you, corrects spelling and saves keystrokes! Thank you for using PleXKeys. PleXKeys automatically adapts its predictions, based on your actual keyboard input, resulting in predictions that are based not just on the words you use, but also the way you type. Out of the box PleXKeys will predict the words you are going to use rather well but, the more you use PleXKeys the better it will get! After about a week, PleXKeys will have adapted its predictions so that entire sentences can be completed in a few keystrokes.\n\nWhat's new in this version: Several new features, shorthand macros and a few small bug fixes.\n\nRead more: PleXKeys - Free software downloads and software reviews - CNEThttp://download.cnet.com/PleXKeys/3000-2084_4-75453685.html?tag=mncol;1#ixzz1aazGwyWI\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d628306166d440dbf4ef9337b3c68ad5b6ac4af","amp;dn":"PleXKeys+Predictive+Typing+For+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d628306166d440dbf4ef9337b3c68ad5b6ac4af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,98,131,6,22,109,68,13,191,78,249,51,123,60,104,173,91,106,196,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
