You see, Unreal 2: The Awakening had nothing to do with the unreal world and with the original story. So, in Return to Na Pali, you are saved by army forces and dropped back onto the planet to retrieve an object. One more ride with the skaarj for you. Have in mind that the game runs perfectly on older systems but on systems with 2 processors or more you may experience ultra fast or ultra slow speed as happens with other old games. Disabling the processor and leaving only one should do the trick. Unpack, run the setup and play the game. Have fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:952a68c1c226c75c8dda59bbc65f67f9021c769a","amp;dn":"unreal+-++na+pali+mission+pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"952a68c1c226c75c8dda59bbc65f67f9021c769a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,42,104,193,194,38,199,92,141,218,89,187,198,95,103,249,2,28,118,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
