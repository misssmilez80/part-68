It isn't on DVD and the only torrent I have found has been dead for a long time. Well I found the movie and here it is.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Camp North Pines for Boys, the campers, led by the charismatic Franklin Reilly, stage a revolt against the strick owner, Mr. Warren, and lock him and the rest of the councelers up and take over the camp for themselves. But the revol soon spirals out of control as the boys also lead a takeover of the nearby girls camp as well. Then, Mr. Warren is accidently killed trying to escape. And, soon friction happens between the two boys and girls camps, which only one camper, a certain Donald Poultry, tries to get the word out and unseat Franklin as the leader.
