And it\\'s happening in Iraq. \nConsidered to be the original Garden of Eden the marshes \nwere once Iraq\\'s wildlife jewel where man and nature \nthrived for 5000 years. But in the 1990s Saddam Hussein \ndrained these gigantic wetlands and turned them into a \ndesert destroying a home to thousands of people and \nmillions of birds. Donning his body armour filmmaker \nDavid Johnson travels to the Mesopotamian Marshes to \nfollow the work of Azzam Alwash the visionary Iraqi \nengineer at the centre of this extraordinary scheme to \nre-flood hundreds of miles of desert and bring back life to \nthe sands. This is a view of Iraq the world never sees a \nworld of huge reed beds and vast flocks of birds that fill \nthe sky. But nothing ever quite goes to plan in Iraq.\n.\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9775209ddc8b86ce423fa29c075ce90ae7aaf121","amp;dn":"Natural.World.Special.Miracle.In.The.Marshes.Of.Iraq.HDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9775209ddc8b86ce423fa29c075ce90ae7aaf121","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,117,32,157,220,139,134,206,66,63,162,156,7,92,233,10,231,170,241,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
