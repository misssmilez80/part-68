But when a mysterious package mistakenly arrives at KumarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s door on Christmas Eve, his attempt to redirect it to HaroldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s house ends with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhigh gradeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ contents-and HaroldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father-in-lawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prize Christmas tree-going up in smoke. With his in-laws out of the house for the day, Harold decides to cover his tracks, rather than come clean. Reluctantly embarking on another ill-advised journey with Kumar through New York City, their search for the perfect replacement tree takes them through party heaven-and almost blows Christmas Eve sky high.\n\nGenre: Comedy\nIMDB rating: 7,2/10\nDirected by: Todd Strauss-Schulson\nStarring: Kal Penn, John Cho and Neil Patrick Harris..\n\nRelease Name: A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas 2011 TS XviD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ MiSTEREI\nSize: 1,24 GB\nQuality: 720 x 304 2 041 Kbps, MP3 128 kbps\nRuntime: 1 h 20 mins ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11a338187b29e47366adbce9af727578bce42c96","amp;dn":"A+Very+Harold+%26amp%3B+Kumar+3D+Christmas+2011+TS+XviD-MiSTERE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11a338187b29e47366adbce9af727578bce42c96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,163,56,24,123,41,228,115,102,173,188,233,175,114,117,120,188,228,44,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
