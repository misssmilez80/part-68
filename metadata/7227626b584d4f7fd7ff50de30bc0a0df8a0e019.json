The group consists of Charles Bissell, Greg Whelan, Kevin Whelan, and Jerry MacDonald. Their debut album Silver was released in 1994. The band was plagued by label problems throughout the 1990s, leaving them unable to release an album for many years after 1996's Secaucus. The band's third offering, The Meadowlands, finally surfaced in late 2003. Following a gig at University of London Union in London in March 2006, The Guardian declared: &quot;On this form the Wrens are surely one of the best live bands in the world.&quot;\n\nCharles Bissell, Greg Whelan, Kevin Whelan, and Jerry MacDonald formed a band in the late '80s under the name Low. They eventually released a 7&quot; under this name. They were signed to the label Grass Records soon after, but changed their name to The Wrens after learning about the popular slowcore group that was also named Low. By 1996, The Wrens had released two albums, Silver (1994) and Secaucus (1996). Both arrived to critical acclaim and a fair following of fans. Meanwhile, Grass Records was bought by Alan Meltzer, who wanted to focus more on popularity and hit songs. He tried to force the Wrens to sign a new, bigger contract, as well as to make more radio-friendly music, but the band refused. As a result, they were dropped from the label and production of their previous two releases was halted.[2] Meltzer ended up changing Grass Records' name to Wind-up Records and signing the band Creed.\n\nThe Wrens continued to make music quietly. With the exception of MacDonald, all of the band's members lived in the same house. Together they continued to write and record songs while also maintaining daytime jobs. Over the next seven years, the band was in limbo, searching for a new home while still trying to put a new album together. Finally, in 2003, the band released its third full-length album, The Meadowlands. The new album was a resounding success for The Wrens, achieving positive reviews in publications such as AllMusic,[3] Pitchfork[2] and praise from critic Robert Christgau.[4] The album was described by The New York Times as a &quot;nearly universally acclaimed disc of bright literate pop&quot;.[5]\n\nIn late 2006, Wind-Up records reissued the band's first two albums.[6]\n\nAlso in 2006, The Wrens recorded a cover of the song &quot;They'll Need A Crane&quot; for Hello Radio, a tribute album to They Might Be Giants.\n\nThe Wrens are currently working on a follow-up album to The Meadowlands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecaucus 1996\n\n\nSecaucus is a 1996 album by The Wrens, an American rock band from New Jersey. Secaucus is named for the city in which it was recorded, Secaucus, New Jersey. The Wrens were signed to major label Grass Records at the time of their tour supporting this album. The album had received excellent reviews from critics and fans alike, however, Grass dropped the band after they refused to be forced into a new contract. The Wrens' follow-up to Secaucus, The Meadowlands, was released seven years after, in 2003.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Yellow Number Three&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:04\n2.\t&quot;Built in Girls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n3.\t&quot;Surprise, Honeycomb&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n4.\t&quot;Rest Your Head&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n5.\t&quot;Won't Get Too Far&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n6.\t&quot;Joneses Rule of Sport&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n7.\t&quot;Dance the Midwest&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:20\n8.\t&quot;Still Complaining&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:43\n9.\t&quot;Hats off to Marriage, Baby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n10.\t&quot;Jane Fakes a Hug&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n11.\t&quot;Counted on Sweetness&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:54\n12.\t&quot;I've Made Enough Friends&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n13.\t&quot;Luxury&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35\n14.\t&quot;Indie 500&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n15.\t&quot;Safe and Comfortable&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n16.\t&quot;Destruction/Drawn&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:28\n17.\t&quot;I Married Sonja&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:43\n18.\t&quot;I'll Mind You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:25\n19.\t&quot;It's Not Getting Any Good&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meadowlands 2003\n\n\nThe Meadowlands, the third studio album by The Wrens, was released by Absolutely Kosher Records on September 9, 2003. Due to troubles with The Wrens' label Grass Records (now Wind-up Records), The Wrens were put on a very long hiatus. Finally, The Meadowlands was released seven years after Secaucus.[1] It was subsequently released in Europe by LO-MAX Records.\n\nThe album was described by The New York Times as a &quot;nearly universally acclaimed disc of bright literate pop&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;The House That Guilt Built&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:22\n2.\t&quot;Happy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33\n3.\t&quot;She Sends Kisses&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:57\n4.\t&quot;This Boy Is Exhausted&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n5.\t&quot;Hopeless&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:08\n6.\t&quot;Faster Gun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n7.\t&quot;Thirteen Grand&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n8.\t&quot;Boys, You Won't Remember&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n9.\t&quot;Ex-Girl Collection&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n10.\t&quot;Per Second Second&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n11.\t&quot;Everyone Choose Sides&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n12.\t&quot;13 Months in 6 Minutes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:50\n13.\t&quot;This Is Not What You Had Planned&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:37\n\n\n\nEnjoy The Wrens :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7227626b584d4f7fd7ff50de30bc0a0df8a0e019","amp;dn":"Wrens+-+Secaucus+%26amp%3B+Meadowlands+1996+-+2003+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7227626b584d4f7fd7ff50de30bc0a0df8a0e019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,39,98,107,88,77,79,127,215,255,80,222,48,188,10,13,248,160,224,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
