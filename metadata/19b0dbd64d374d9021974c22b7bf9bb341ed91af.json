He moves to the house of an undertaker, but after an unfair severe spank, he starts a seven day runaway to London. He arrives exhausted and starving, and is welcomed by a gang of pickpockets leaded by the old crook Fagin. When he is mistakenly taken as a thief, the wealthy victim Mr. Brownlow brings Oliver to his home and shelters him. But Fagin and the dangerous Bill Sykes decide to kidnap Oliver to burglarize Mr. Brownlow's fancy house. Oliver is wounded, while Mr. Brownlow tries to save Oliver.\n\nPlease SEED.\n\nIt's my first torrent so please write a comment.\n\nNo viruses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19b0dbd64d374d9021974c22b7bf9bb341ed91af","amp;dn":"Oliver+Twist%282005%29+DVDRIP-simiskos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19b0dbd64d374d9021974c22b7bf9bb341ed91af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,176,219,214,77,55,77,144,33,151,76,34,183,191,155,179,65,237,145,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
