Well, it was probably because of       \n    what he saw Sister Sarah Jane doing on his behalf. This                  \n    Bible-thumping humper just can't stand the notion of &quot;pleasurable        \n    sex&quot; (which she pronounces in an accent so antebellum that you half      \n    expect her to start crying out for Ashley Wilkes), and decides that      \n    the best way to purge the world of &quot;evil men&quot; is to fornicate them to    \n    death. So our erotic evangelical picks up sleazeballs in bars, brings    \n    them home, and stabs them to death while in the throes of                \n    passionor what passes for passion in Sister Sarah's                   \n    blood-splattered arms. After moving to L.A., our homicidal heroine       \n    recruits poor unloved lesbian socialite Penny, who immediately           \n    becomes a member of Sister Sarah's Sacred Order of the Sisters of        \n    Complete Subjugation. Together, they vow to clean up God's earthly       \n    kingdom, one oversexed drunk at a time. It's just like the Good Book     \n    saysEvil Come, Evil Go.                                               \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
