Master the Ring - Wield the Green Lantern Power Ring to create a spectacular \n   range of &quot;hard-light&quot; constructs including a mini gun, giant fists, and much \n   more, all of which can be linked together to form an endless number of \n   combinations.\n\n2. Stand Together - Join forces with a friend to play as Hal Jordan or Sinestro to \n   battle the Manhunters, with the ability to drop in or out at will.\n\n3. Take Flight - Dodge, blast, and destroy legions of enemies as you soar across  \n   the universe in battles of intergalactic scope.\n\nSynopsis\n--------\nThe Manhunters are an android race, originally created by the Guardians of the Universe to serve as the first interstellar police force. The Manhunters became more obsessed with administering punishment than serving justice, forcing the Guardians to dissolve their ranks. The few Manhunters that survived fled into exile and the Guardians founded a new elite police force called the Green Lantern Corps and armed its members with specially crafted power rings. Now the Manhunters are back and out for revenge, readying their forces for a war against the Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps. Faced with destruction, the Corps is looking to gifted but cocky test pilot Hal Jordan as the newest recruit, to protect peace and preserve justice.[6]\n\nCharacters\n----------\nHal Jordan - A second-generation test pilot, Hal Jordan was given the power ring and battery by a dying alien named Abin Sur, whose spaceship crashed on Earth. Abin Sur used his ring to seek out an individual who was &quot;utterly honest and born without fear&quot; to take his place as Green Lantern.\n\nSinestro - Sinestro's desire for order did well by him in the Green Lantern Corps, and initially led him to be considered one of the greatest Green Lanterns. His need for structure and power led him to feel that the Corps is not doing enough to maintain control, an idea he relays with great passion to his pupil, new Lantern Hal Jordan.\n\nKilowog - Kilowog was chosen as a Green Lantern because of having an &quot;Indomitable Will&quot;. When commanding a Power Ring, Kilowog is supremely powerful, coupled together with his own natural strength and stamina, increases his power when wielding a ring, which is why he is the chosen Green Lantern trainer. The Power Ring enables Kilowog to create a Green Aura that surrounds his body and transforms his clothing into Green Lantern attire. It also enables Kilowog to create any construct that he can imagine, fly and enter hyperspace and also create almost impenetrable force fields.\n\nGanthet - As one of the Guardians of the Universe Ganthet is very wise, and stays at his sector, Space Sector 0000, with the other Guardians.\n\nMain Villains\n-------------\nAmon Sur - Amon Sur appears in the game as he attends his father's funeral on Oa, expressing gratitude that his father met his successor before he died before the Manhunters attack Oa. However, he is later revealed to have betrayed the Corps to the Manhunters as part of a plan to 'avenge' himself against the Corps, angry that his father's ring was passed to a primitive like Hal Jordan rather than himself, helping the Manhunters access the yellow fear energy that the Guardians had kept contained in a secret vault to give them the power to destroy the Corps. Despite wielding a staff empowered by the yellow energy, Amon is finally defeated by Hal in a final attack on Oa.\n\nThe Manhunters - The Manhunters are a race of extraterrestrial robots, that attack Oa.\n\nVoice cast\n----------\n    Ryan Reynolds - Green Lantern/Hal Jordan\n    Steven Blum - Amon Sur\n    Marton Csokas - Sinestro\n    Olivia d'Abo - Queen Aga'po\n    Grey DeLisle - Hal Jordan's Ring\n    Michael Jackson - Ganthet\n    Wendee Lee - Zamarons\n    Kevin Michael Richardson - Kilowog\n    Fred Tatasciore - The Manhunters\n    Wally Wingert - Lanterns\n\nCrew\n----\nMaria Estrada - Voice Director\n\nReception\n---------\nGreen Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters received moderately positive reviews.
