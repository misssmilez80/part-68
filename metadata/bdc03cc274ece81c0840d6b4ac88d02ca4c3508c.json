Though produced on a low budget this film is highly ambitious, with everything from CGI aliens, a sexy alien ambassador with hair that can be grown at will, numerous stunts including a car jump, a duo of somersaulting attacking school girls and a racist &amp; alien conspiracy thrown in for good measure.\nAliens appear at the UN and invite Earth to join the Galactic Federation, but there is a catch, Earth has one year to prepare and send a team of its best fighters off-world to the Galactic Combat Games to represent the planet in an unarmed combat tournament, where the fate of the Earth will depend on the tournaments outcome. This film is the first in a planed series of films. In this film we see the UK trials, cumulating in a team being picked to represent the UK in the forthcoming World selection trials.\nTarget audience: Teen and the young at heart. UK cert rating PG.\nContent: Features over thirty, very realistic martial-arts fights, in over a dozen different disciplines. Shot on a low budget in the UK this film was a feature length pilot for a yet to be produced global franchised TV series, where national teams would be decided to then compete against each other in a global competition to find a team to represent Earth in the Galactic Combat games. \nStarring: Gordon Alexander (Sucker Punch, DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Let Him In), Elizabeth Tan, Silvio Simac (Transporter 3, Unleashed), Tom Wu (The Tournament), Adrian &amp; Neil Rayment (The Evil Twins from The Matrix Reloaded), Troy Titus-Adams\n\nImdb.com  rating: 6.7\n \nImdb.com direct link below  for  full cast, crew, stills and web-links  etc\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330972/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330972/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nHD Trailer for the UK independent martial-arts/sci-fi feature film Intergalactic Combat\n\nNB Please note the full feature will be posted up on thepiratebay  very shortly\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc03cc274ece81c0840d6b4ac88d02ca4c3508c","amp;dn":"HD+Trailer+for+Intergalactic+Combat+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc03cc274ece81c0840d6b4ac88d02ca4c3508c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,192,60,194,116,236,232,28,8,64,214,180,172,136,208,44,164,195,80,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
