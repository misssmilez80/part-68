It is their only official studio album to feature original bass player Dave Shogren on all tracks, who left during the recording of their second album.\n\nThe first single from the album, &quot;Nobody,&quot; failed to chart, as did the album itself. The single was re-released in 1974 after the group had become a highly successful touring and recording act, peaking at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Nobody&quot; was later re-recorded for the group's 2010 album, World Gone Crazy.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n\n   01. &quot;Nobody&quot; (Johnston) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n   02. &quot;Slippery St. Paul&quot; (Simmons) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:14\n   03. &quot;Greenwood Creek&quot; (Johnston) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n   04. &quot;It Won't Be Right&quot; (Johnston) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n   05. &quot;Travelin' Man&quot; (Johnston) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n   06. &quot;Feelin' Down Farther&quot; (Johnston) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n   07. &quot;The Master&quot; (Johnston) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n   08. &quot;Growin' a Little Each Day&quot; (Johnston) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n   09. &quot;Beehive State&quot; (Randy Newman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42\n   10. &quot;Closer Every Day&quot; (Simmons) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n   11. &quot;Chicago&quot; (trad., arr.
