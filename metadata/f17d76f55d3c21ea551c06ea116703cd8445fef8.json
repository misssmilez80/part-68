Still featuring the talents of lead vocalists Hannah Hooper and Christian Zucconi, Grouplove tend toward creating passionate, anthemic pop moments that are equal parts post-MGMT indie soul and post-Killers dance-rock. Songs Tongue Tied, Spun, and Love Will Save Your Soul have a rollicking, post-punk exuberance while more hippie-dippy cuts such as Colours and Naked Kids (a carry-over from the EP) bring to mind such psychedelic touchstones as the Flaming Lips and late-60s Beach Boys.  Ultimately, Grouploves Never Trust a Happy Song is a cohesive if ramshackle crowd-pleaser, full of melodic double-lead vocals, handclaps, ringing electric guitars, and staccato synth parts that tips a hat to 80s dance-rock while still retaining the bands obvious love of experimental 60s folk-rock.\n\nReleased: Sept 13, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~960 kbps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
