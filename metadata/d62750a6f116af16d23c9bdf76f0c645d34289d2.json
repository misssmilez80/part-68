The music is however so tremendously good, that I really had to share this. It was not found on Pirate Bay yet!\n\nTogether with this torrent comes a few pictures that was found in the songbook and the labels; anything else needed, just mention it.\n\nEnjoy and help me seeding this beautiful music.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d62750a6f116af16d23c9bdf76f0c645d34289d2","amp;dn":"Scott+Joplin%5C%27s+Treemonisha+-+Opera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d62750a6f116af16d23c9bdf76f0c645d34289d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,39,80,166,241,22,175,22,210,60,155,223,118,240,198,69,211,66,137,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
