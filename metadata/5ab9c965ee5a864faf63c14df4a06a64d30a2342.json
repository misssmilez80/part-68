As the X-Men suspect this to be the work of the U-Men, a group of humans that harvest mutant organs in order to produce counter measures against mutants, they soon learn yet another mutant boy has gone missing. As they split up to investigate, Beast realises the call was bait to lure them into a trap, and they are soon attacked by the U-Men's robots. After defeating the robots, the X-Men regroup and head to an abandoned hospital which is hought to be the U-Men's base. There, they find the missing boy being pumped with chemicals and transform into a huge monster.

Before passing away, the boy asks the X-Men to save the others.
