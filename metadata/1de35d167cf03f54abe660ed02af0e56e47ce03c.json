It was a bitter departure brought on by a horrible economy, a very old arena, and no options on the horizon. Mark Chipman had tried to buy the Jets in the mid-1990s but it didn't work. So he bought the Minnesota Moose of the AHL and moved them to Winnipeg. Then came a new arena and a partnership with Lord Thomson of Fleet, who owned the land where the MTS Centre was built. In 2010 they tried to buy back the franchise from Phoenix but it fell through at the last minute. A year later the Atlanta Thrashers were for sale and relocation and this time they got the team. \n\nThe programme was broadcast in a bit of a retro style - shown without a bug, without snipes, and with almost completely clean end credits (the last frame had music from The Fifth Estate overlaid). There were however a few glitches in the video itself but they appeared in the broadcast from other stations too.\n\nMy grandfather was born in Winnipeg and even after moving to Ontario once the Jets came to be they were his team. He didn't get to be here for their return but this is released in memory of him. \n\n\n        Go Sens Go  / Go Jets Go / Go Home Leafs\n\n\n\nComplete name                    : HNIC.Fuelled.By.Passion-The.Return.Of.The.Jets.WS.XviD-jAh.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 550 MiB\nDuration                         : 45mn 1s\nOverall bit rate mode            : Variable\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 707 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 1\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 45mn 1s\nBit rate                         : 1 582 Kbps\nWidth                            : 624 pixels\nHeight                           : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.240\nStream size                      : 509 MiB (93%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 45mn 1s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 111 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 35.9 MiB (7%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 582 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings                : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1de35d167cf03f54abe660ed02af0e56e47ce03c","amp;dn":"Fuelled.By.Passion-The.Return.Of.The.Jets.WS.XviD-jAh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1de35d167cf03f54abe660ed02af0e56e47ce03c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,227,93,22,124,240,63,84,171,230,96,237,2,175,14,86,228,124,224,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
