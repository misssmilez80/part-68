After a lavish party, Michael and his wife, Elizabeth (Genevieve Bujold) hear a scream from their daughter Amy's bedroom. Elizabeth runs to see what's wrong, but doesn't return, and by the time Michael reaches the room, both have disappeared but he finds a ransom note demanding $500,000.\n\nIn order to save his family, Michael arranges to sell his interest in the business to his partner, Robert LaSalle (John Lithgow), but Inspector Brie of the New Orleans police advises against giving in to the kidnappers. An attache case filled with fake notes and a radio transmitter is handed over, and a furious chase ensues when the kidnapper escape with Elizabeth and Amy ending in a collision with a petrol tanker. The kidnappers' car bursts into flames and plunges into the river, apparantly killing Michael's beloved wife and daughter.\n\nSixteen years later, Michael and La Salle go to Florence on a business trip. Michael can't resist revisiting the cathedral where he met Elizabeth and it is here that he meets a young Italian woman called Sandra, who bears a striking resemblance to his late wife.\n\nSandra (also played by Genevieve Bujold) and Michael fall in love and return to the States, and Sandra develops a fascination for Elizabeth, even wearing her jewellry and styling her hair in the same way. However, Michael's new found happiness is short-lived. During their wedding night, Sandra disappears, and Michael awakes to find a ransom note....\n\nThe haunting music was scored by Bernard Hermann and was nominated for an Oscar for `Best Original Score' in 1977. Hermann also composed the music for Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, which inspired De Palma to write Obsession.\n\n\n\nDirector Brian De Palma\nCertificate 15 years and over\nYear 1976\nScreen Widescreen 2.35:1 Anamorphic\nLanguages English - Dolby Digital (5.1)\nSubtitles Nordic\nDuration 1 hour and 36 minutes (approx)\nRegion Region 2 \n\nSpecial Features\n\nDocumentary - `Obsession Revisted', featuring director/writer Brian de Palma, Genevieve Bujold, Cliff Robertson, producer George Litto and director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond talking about the making of the film \nTheatrical trailer \nFilmographies \nInteractive menu \nScene access\n\nActors\n\nCliff Robertson, Genevieve Bujold, John Lithgow, Wanda Blackman, J.
