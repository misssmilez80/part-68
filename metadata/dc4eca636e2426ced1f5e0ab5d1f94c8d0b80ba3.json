Knox - Aired 05/10/2011\n\nEvery now and then a researcher will discover a historical enigma, an unproven rumor, a story with a puzzling outcome. Such encounters are an irresistible challenge for Brad Meltzer, the #1 New York Times best-selling author. What if I told you Fort Knox was empty? Buddy, Scott and McKinley travel to Kentucky to investigate the history of the legendary vault, and discover the devastating impact it would have on our economy and our pocketbooks if the gold were gone. Fort Knox has not been audited since 1974, but does that mean the government is shielding its empty pocket book from the prying eyes of the American public, or is the privacy in place to protect a different secret altogether?
