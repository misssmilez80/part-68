If your a risk taker, willing to learn, or have a working knowledge of linux. Shard Linux might be for you then.\nBecause of these set of rules and the way it was put together, Shard Linux has very low system requirements and can run on even the slowest of 686 processors. \n\nShard Linux comes in 2 diffrent ISO's a Stable Iso or a Beta 'Testing' ISO. Each is still based on Debian stable but the beta just has adjustments over the stable once the adjustments have been confirmed to be good and no bugs the beta will go to the release and be considered stable.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/shardlinux/index.php?title=Main_Page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/shardlinux/index.php?title=Main_Page&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/shardlinux/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/shardlinux/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/shardlinux/files/Release/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/shardlinux/files/Release/&lt;/a&gt; (stable) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/shardlinux/files/Beta/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/shardlinux/files/Beta/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freecode.com/projects/shard-linux&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freecode.com/projects/shard-linux&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsha1sum :681cb002212d92d2568aed3dda221f09cfe4f086  v3beta2.iso\nmd5sum : 5420988baa3acece9c39a3a0f750c371  v3beta2.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4d7c0f343abb5076205d66cb9e11f9a45abe41d","amp;dn":"shard-linux-v3beta2.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4d7c0f343abb5076205d66cb9e11f9a45abe41d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,215,192,243,67,171,181,7,98,5,214,108,185,225,31,154,69,171,228,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
