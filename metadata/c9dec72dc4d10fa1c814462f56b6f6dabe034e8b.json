I uploaded this game previously in some other sites, but i couldn't seed at that time because of my poor internet speed. Now that i have upgraded my internet speed, i will seed this for a long time.. i promise. So please take your time and download this game. This works fine, believe me. I played this game last year, and I want to share the same with you all. If you follow the instructions given... surely it will work (the system requirements also matters). Please say thanks if you liked my rip -- that will encourage me to upload more... :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9dec72dc4d10fa1c814462f56b6f6dabe034e8b","amp;dn":"PC-Frontlines.Fuel.Of.War.RIP+%28reup%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9dec72dc4d10fa1c814462f56b6f6dabe034e8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,222,199,45,196,209,15,161,200,20,70,47,86,182,246,218,190,3,78,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
