The game takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a high fantasy campaign setting, using a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (AD&amp;D) 2nd edition rules. The game received critical praise, and was credited (along with Diablo) with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.\n\nhe game story takes place in the licensed fictional world of Ed Greenwood's Forgotten Realms setting, which provides a rich and well-developed fantasy environment. The mechanics of the gameplay were coded to conform to the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition role-playing rules, though various elements from the ruleset were modified to allow the game to be executed in pausable realtime mode. Hence, although each character is in constant action, the game allows the player to pause the activity at any time.\n\nDuring the game, past and present events are related to the player through dialogue, written text, journal entries, or cut scenes. Dialogue is initiated when the player clicks on computer controlled characters. This generates written and sometimes spoken dialogue with selectable responses. Such interactions can lead to quests or missions.\n\nThe game is separated into seven chapters interspersed with segments of spoken dialogue. Free exploration of the world map is allowed in every chapter, though some areas are not unlocked until the player's character (PC) advances to a certain point in the game. The PC begins as a weak character, poorly equipped and without allies. As the game progresses, the player discovers new and more powerful equipment and magic, and can recruit a party of up to six characters, including the PC. Experience points are gained through completing quests and killing monsters, and then at predetermined thresholds the characters' levels increase resulting in improved abilities and scores.\n\nThe flow of time during the game is expressed by changes in lighting and the opening and closing of most shops, with an increased likelihood of combat encounters during the night. Taverns are open during the night, but there are no changes in the presence of customers or the barkeeper to reflect the flow of time. The troupe of characters controlled by the player will become fatigued after traveling for a full day, which requires rest to recover.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40cd077ed799e6ba2802b23d235d6c39e7aee678","amp;dn":"Baldur%27s+Gate+I%2C+Tales+of+the+Sword+Coast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40cd077ed799e6ba2802b23d235d6c39e7aee678","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,205,7,126,215,153,230,186,40,2,178,61,35,93,108,57,231,174,230,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
