From savoury faves such as cheese straws, avocado &amp; prawn cocktail and quiche Lorraine to delectable desserts such as baked Alaska and Black Forest gateau, it's in Valentine's hands to decide whether the food he's made really has stood the test of time or if it's best left in the past.\n\n\n\n\nValentine Warner Eats... - S01 - E01 - The 60's\nValentine Warner Eats... - S01 - E02 - The 60's\n\n\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 500 MiB\nDuration                                 : 43mn 23s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 611 Kbps\n\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 43mn 23s\nBit rate                                 : 1 494 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf1724cd750c31491886852c72faafdb0279acfd","amp;dn":"Valentine+Warner+Eats...+-+Series+01+-+The+60%5C%27s+-+TVrip+-+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf1724cd750c31491886852c72faafdb0279acfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,23,36,205,117,12,49,73,24,134,133,44,114,250,175,219,2,121,172,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
