Joe Tiberi of Mechina once again handled production and recording duties, as well as the mixing and mastering.\n\nDark Spectrum is a unique melodic blackened death metal band from Chicago inspired by the greats such as At the Gates, Dissection, Hypocrisy, and Cannibal Corpse. Writing about religion, society and control, and combining the dark, haunting, tremelo picked melodies of Swedish black metal and meshing them with the traditional American elements of death and thrash metal; with neo-classical shred the likes of Jason Becker and Jeff Loomis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f09d9056a9780db5d7ba350d8db4de2e7d33a764","amp;dn":"Dark+Spectrum+-+Perplexed+in+Chaos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f09d9056a9780db5d7ba350d8db4de2e7d33a764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,157,144,86,169,120,13,181,215,186,53,13,141,180,222,46,125,51,167,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
