The author, a well-known and respected authority on both processes, presents the theory of the technology, then discusses practical applications the engineer working in the field can implement.\n\nBoth hot-button issues in the industry, these processes will help companies in the energy industry &quot;go green,&quot; by creating a safer, cleaner environment. These techniques also create a more efficient and profitable process in the plant, cutting waste and making operations more streamlined.\n\nThis outstanding new reference includes:\n\n    *\n\n      Uses of acid gas injection, the method of choice for disposing of small quantities of acid gas\n    *\n\n      Coverage of technologies for working towards a zero-emission process in natural gas production\n    *\n\n      A practical discussion of carbon dioxide sequestration, an emerging new topic, often described as one of the possible solutions for reversing global warming\n    *\n\n      Problems and solutions for students at the graduate level and industry course participants\n\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 277 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley-Scrivener; 1 edition (June 8, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470625937\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470625934","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df678f7e70c187c66f999fee3cecb8641ec13071","amp;dn":"Acid+Gas+Injection+and+Carbon+Dioxide+Sequestration%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df678f7e70c187c66f999fee3cecb8641ec13071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,103,143,126,112,193,135,198,111,153,159,238,60,236,184,100,30,193,48,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
