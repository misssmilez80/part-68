They shoot and wound him, but he gets away. They  pursue, led by the dour Carver, who will pay them each $1 a day once  he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s captured. The hunted is Gideon, resourceful, skilled with a knife.  Gideon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s flight and Carver\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hunt require horses, water, and bullets.  The course takes them past lone settlers, a wagon train, a rail crew,  settlements, and an Indian philosopher. What is the reason for the hunt;  what connects Gideon and Carver? What happened at Seraphim Falls?[/B]\n[B] [IMG]http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/4710/relinfo.png[/IMG][/B]\n[IMG]http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/4663/sf02g.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/3281/samplejc.png[/IMG]\n[B][SIZE=3]&gt;[/SIZE][/B]\n[IMG]http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/2256/scrs.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/9721/sf03b.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/4087/sf04.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img560.imageshack.us/img560/1684/sf05.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/4078/sf06.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/8509/sf07b.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img811.imageshack.us/img811/7886/sf08.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img821.imageshack.us/img821/4809/sf09.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/4592/sf10.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img542.imageshack.us/img542/3441/sf11.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/537/sf12.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img828.imageshack.us/img828/1382/sf13.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/1590/sf14.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/1980/sf15.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img851.imageshack.us/img851/2139/sf16d.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/2555/sf17y.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/3412/sf18.png[/IMG]\n  \n[/CENTER]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43d7277a7dd0dab3a167ef371aa433eeeaa05fc7","amp;dn":"Seraphim+Falls.2006.720p.BDRip.Dual+Audio.%5BEng%2BHindi%5D-%3DGhunio%3D-%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43d7277a7dd0dab3a167ef371aa433eeeaa05fc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,215,39,122,125,208,218,179,161,103,239,55,26,164,51,238,234,160,95,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
