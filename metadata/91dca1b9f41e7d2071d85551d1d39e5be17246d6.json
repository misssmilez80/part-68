The descendant of the woman he wanted to marry already has a boyfriend: a brave young boy named Cody, who lives with his swindler uncle Morty and together they run a tour company called Darkside Tours. Leprechaun soon wakes up, kills a bunch of people and kidnaps his bride to be. It's soon up to Cody to save her, and only wrought iron can destroy a Leprechaun. Morty has an idea, but it soon goes horribly wrong when he gets too greedy. Cody ventures into Leprechaun's home to save Bridget, but little does he know that a leprechaun's home has many surprises.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110329/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110329/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91dca1b9f41e7d2071d85551d1d39e5be17246d6","amp;dn":"Leprechaun+2+%281994%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91dca1b9f41e7d2071d85551d1d39e5be17246d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,220,161,185,244,30,125,32,113,216,85,81,209,211,158,91,225,114,70,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
