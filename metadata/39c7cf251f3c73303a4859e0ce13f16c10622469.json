How Many New CDs Have You Thought Were Worth Buying Since Then?\n\nThis Disc is not available in retail stores, as it is the simple results of a Home Studio project. Jammer Productions started out with the simple idea of doing a comparison screening of each and every song from Johnny Cash\\'s Last Recordings (released so far..). The Box Set: American Volumes #1 to #6 [Recorded in 1993 to 2003] solely represents what has became known as Cash\\'s \\&quot;Last Recordings\\&quot;, which we are now up to American Vol #6 as the record company slowly releases what they have to the public through the years since Johnny\\'s death. As of press date there are 6 Volumes of Johnny Cash American, and all recorded between dates 1993 to 2003. There may be new ones released in the future. If you like this music a lot I hope everyone that can afford the price and likes this music will buy the music within the American disc collection. (Amazon offers the set at a very fair price)\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n================================================================================================\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n                               Details follow - The Voters:\n\n                               What We defined as A \\&quot;Hit\\&quot;:\n\n*In This Post Napster Music ERA, NOTHING Was Based On Purchases, Nor AirPlay!*. \n\nInstead, we decided to gather some hard core Johnny Cash Fans, to do their own voting on the best to worse songs within this Collection. One had to be a true-blue solid Cash Fan in order to vote, so the following Credentials wear placed into place for any potential J.C. Voter:\n\n#1) All Song Raters HAD to be self-described Johnny Cash Fans.\n\n#2) All Song Raters HAD to have at least purchased a single Audio CD from the collection: American - Cash \n\n#3) A Final Requirement was asked of everybody on our Cash\\'s Final Song Judgment List: Any such J.C. Song Rater HAD to have watched at LEAST 1/2 of the Biographical movie \\&quot;Walk the Line\\&quot; (2005) all about Johnny\\'s life. Because many critics did not like the movie we decided to allow fans (to Vote) that refused to watch over half of this biography movie.\n\n                             Finally - The Greatest Hit Voters -\n\nThe fans that meet all three Credentials above were limited in numbers. In a short period we had a list of six (6) people that meet the three credentials to become a Johnny Cash voter on this project. Additionally, we asked the voters to avoid listening to other music of any genre until they rated all of Volumes 1 thru 6 of Cash\\'s American songs. Nobody was compensated, as this was all done in jest and for the fun it could give many people.\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n================================================================================================\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n                            \n                                  The Results?:\n\nOne Full CD With The Greatest Hits (despite no airplay often) From All Six Of The American\\'s Cash\\'s Box Set.
