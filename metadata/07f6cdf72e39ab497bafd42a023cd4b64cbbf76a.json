Did we evolve from ape--or is our intelligence the result of contact with an otherworldly source? Could unexplained advances in human evolution be the work of interstellar beings? 10,000-year-old petroglyphs link our ancient ancestors with star beings. Might evidence of alien contact help unlock the mystery of the Creation of Man?\n \nPS3 &amp; X360 Ready.\n \nRelease Notes:\nThere was NO high-definition broadcast of this episode.\nEven on the HD channel it was broadcasted in standard definition.\nThis is as good as it will get and to me it looks pretty damn decent - huge improvement over the previous XviD release.\nIf/when History HD re-airs the episode in true HD you can count on those wonderful scene guys to release something proper for your viewing enjoyment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07f6cdf72e39ab497bafd42a023cd4b64cbbf76a","amp;dn":"Ancient.Aliens.S03E16.Aliens.and.the.Creation.of.Man.720p.PDTV.x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07f6cdf72e39ab497bafd42a023cd4b64cbbf76a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,246,205,247,46,57,171,73,123,175,212,42,2,60,212,182,76,187,247,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
