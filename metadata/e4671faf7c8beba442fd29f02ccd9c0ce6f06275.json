Mitch Billy Crystal is a radio station sales executive who finds himself in the throes of a mid-life crisis; accompanied by two friends, Phil Daniel Stern and Ed Bruno Kirby in the grip of similar problems, he heads to New Mexico for his birthday to participate in a two-week &quot;vacation&quot; cattle drive to Colorado. The three friends and the rest of their group, including an attractive, newly single young woman and two African-American dentists, are all urbanites lost when it comes to herding cattle and surviving on the prairie; it's up to authentic, almost mythic cowboy Curly Jack Palance, who won an Oscar for the role, to whip them into shape. As various adventures occur along the way, including run-ins with outlaw cattlehands, treacherous natural mishaps, and Mitch's delivery of a newborn calf, the three &quot;city slickers&quot; open up to each other, learn to appreciate Curly's Old West values, and begin to resolve their midlife dilemmas. When Curly dies, it's left to Mitch, Phil, and Ed to bring in the herd.\n\nVideo: MPEG2 Video 720x576 25fps\nBit rate: 5 250 Kbps\nAspect ratio: 2.35:1\nAudio: English Dolby AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\nSubtitles: English, Swedish, French, Norwegian, Spanish, Finnish, German, Dutch, Danish\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101587/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101587/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4671faf7c8beba442fd29f02ccd9c0ce6f06275","amp;dn":"City+Slickers+1991+PAL+DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4671faf7c8beba442fd29f02ccd9c0ce6f06275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,103,31,175,124,139,235,164,66,253,41,240,44,205,156,12,230,240,98,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
