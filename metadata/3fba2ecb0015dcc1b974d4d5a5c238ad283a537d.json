But some of you good in coding please tweak it. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/be7e63153448107&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/be7e63153448107&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/5afdc2153448108&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/5afdc2153448108&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------\nBulk Sub-folder maker by names or numbers\nyou wanna create 10 -20-1000 subfolders inside a folder? then this is the tool you're looking for.\nsee the screenshot, and you'll understand its operation! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/7b44b9153448103&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/7b44b9153448103&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/e3262b153448104&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/e3262b153448104&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/ffe227153448105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/ffe227153448105&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------\nBulk File Mover and Crap Remover (based on Teracopy)\n\nYou've 50 different folders, some have movies,some ebooks,some game-ISOs. Now manually sorting them out = WASTE of time \nYou've 50 finished torrents, in 50 different folders, each has only one file that you want like a movie / pdf / rar / exe and 4 crappy .nfo,damenoid.txt,ahashare.txt,.url and crap like that. And You didnot have the time to 'deselect' each and every crappy nfo txt file before adding the .torrents.\nHow do you sort this out? Manually cut / copy-pasting every useful file in a different folder? that is WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY.\n\nSo I've came up with a easy solution. Just drag and drop your main folder/directory, and give it parameters, it'll search all its sub-directories and copy/cut/delete the files according to the extentions. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/2b886f153448481&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/2b886f153448481&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------\nBulk Photofile renamer (for those ATK, Met-ART sets)\nSuppose there is a folder.\nC:\\My pictures\\\nIt contains tons of subdirectories and each subdirectory contains 10-15 photos. Now you want to move these photos to one big folder for ease in browsing (or uploading). But then how to know which photo came from which subfolder? (in case u wanna identify the models later on!)\nSo You want those photos to be renamed as %name of the subdirectory%[0,1,2,3,4,5].\nI've created an automated script so you can quickly do it.\n\n--------\nMulti Rename script 1.5c unicode\nThis one is created by a guy named Majkinetor. There two very time saving feature it has.\nPlease take the pain to read following information and you see.\n\n1- Extracting file names for posting in nfo or Torrent description.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/7b92c1153448109&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/7b92c1153448109&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSuppose you've movie files like Hellboy.avi, Spiderman.avi, Harry Potter.avi\nnow when you upload them, you want to write the list in the torrent or warez post.\nThis software can just extract all the filenames from the folder and give you the text list so you don't have to type anything just copy paste.\nPlease see photo to understand what I'm saying\n\n2. Bulk Autorename according to list\n\nSuppose you've file with names 1,2,3,4 and so on.\nYou want the file1 to be renamed as spiderman,\nfile 2 as superman and \nfile3 as spiderman. \nIf you do this manually one by one, it'll take lot of time. Instead just type the list in a notepad, and drag and drop files in this program and it'll rename them accordingly.
