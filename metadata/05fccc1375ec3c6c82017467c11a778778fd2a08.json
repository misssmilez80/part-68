It has everything you need money, violent crooks, killings and \n                   the betrayal of two cops who were supposed to be working for the NYPD but were actually feeding information \n                   to the Mafia. This story is 18 years in the making. It involves the stealing of nearly $300 million in cash, \n                   jewels, and goods. It includes at least a dozen known murders and involves all five New York Mafia families. \n                   Most importantly it involves a group of Mafia detectives that worked the case from start to finish - guys who \n                   normally dont go public. Guys who have until now never told their story. They use sophisticated surveillance \n                   tools combined with New York street smarts to beat the bad guys.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05fccc1375ec3c6c82017467c11a778778fd2a08","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Taking.Down.the.Mob.HDTV.XviD-DiVERGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05fccc1375ec3c6c82017467c11a778778fd2a08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,252,204,19,117,236,60,108,130,1,116,103,193,26,119,135,120,253,42,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
