Still, the spotlight remains Hopkins, who is in fine form here. \n\nTracklist\n1 Wake up Old Lady  4:21 \n2 Don't Embarrass Me, Baby 3: \n3 Stranger Here  5: 53\n4 Little Sister's Boogie 3:34 \n5 Goin' Away 5:49 \n6 You Better Stop Her 4:39 \n7 Business You're Doin' 3:21 \n8 I'm Wit' It  3:56\n\n\nRecorded in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey on June 4, 1963. Originally released on Bluesville (1073).\n\nPersonnel:[/b][/color] Sam &quot;Lightnin'&quot; Hopkins (vocals, guitar); Leonard Gaskins (bass); Herbie Lovelle (drums).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8e320a823ba6ac4f4feb0fba401552b06f71cd8","amp;dn":"Lightnin+Hopkins++Goin+Away+%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8e320a823ba6ac4f4feb0fba401552b06f71cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,227,32,168,35,186,106,196,244,254,176,251,164,1,85,43,6,247,28,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
