These tricks and tactics of defense help animals a lot in their survival on this planet. In this collection we meet some of the worlds most dangerous animals.\n\n\n\nEpisode 1 : Killer Crocs \n\nCosta Rica is home to an exotic and extraordinary collection of wildlife, including the American Crocodile. This one-hour documentary follows the life of a female and her young through the most dramatic events of their lives - mating, birth and growing up.\n\nCosta Rica's breathtaking Pacific coast, rivers and tropical forest serve as a spectacular backdrop as the baby crocodiles struggle to survive against predators such as caimans, coati, giant lizards and wood storks. We also feature the tension between crocodiles and people as poachers endanger our characters' long-term survival in Costa Rica's incredible tropical surroundings.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2123 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.654:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 49:02.840\nNumber Of Parts: 8\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f1be6caa6e0a6487f78165a002ccfaee33fb838","amp;dn":"DC.World%27s.Most.Dangerous.Animals.1of8.Killer.Crocs.XviD.AC3..av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f1be6caa6e0a6487f78165a002ccfaee33fb838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,27,230,202,166,224,166,72,127,120,22,90,0,44,207,174,227,63,184,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
