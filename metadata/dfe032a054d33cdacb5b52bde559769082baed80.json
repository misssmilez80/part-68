The frenchies surfaced in 2006 after the release of a single, a collaboration with Stephen Bradley (No Doubt, Smashing Pumpkins). A string of live shows followed that year, in various venues in Europe and in the USA.\n\nTheir first album, From Zero to One, came out in 2008. Mixed by Antoine Gaillet (Brian Molko, Zombie-Zombie), this album alternates between heady minimalism, hooking pop and Pink Floyd-style climaxes, underscored by lyrics well worth looking into.\n\nThe band's next effort, the Multiple Devils EP, was released in 2010. This EP features combinations of electro, indie-rock and cold-wave to reach new heights, delivering tunes ranging from fiery, rousing electro-rock epiphanies, to joyful yet melancholic ballads and unexpected moments of subtle frailty. Boolfight supported the vinyl release of Multiple Devils with a string of shows in France and in the UK.\n\nIn 2011, Boolfight releases Loose Cannons &amp; B-Sides, a collection of yet unreleased songs. A new album is also announced for 2012: the parisians have teamed up with Nicolas Fromageau (M83, Team Ghost) and readily list shoegaze and post-punk as well as other, more electronic musical genres as their current sources of inspiration.\n\n\nSoundcloud: www.soundcloud.com/boolfight\nFacebook:\niTunes: www.itunes.apple.com/artist/boolfight/id68449667\nTwitter:\nBandcamp: www.boolfight.bandcamp.com/\n\n\n\n** uploaded my www.manchestersound.org - download, listen, enjoy, share **\n** how you can use these tracks - www.manchestersound.org/license/ **\n** frequently asked questions - www.manchestersound.org/license/faq/ **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfe032a054d33cdacb5b52bde559769082baed80","amp;dn":"Boolfight+-+Loose+Cannons+%26amp%3B+B-Sides+%282011%29+%5Bindie-smooth-mel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfe032a054d33cdacb5b52bde559769082baed80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,224,50,160,84,211,60,218,203,91,82,189,229,89,118,144,130,186,237,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
