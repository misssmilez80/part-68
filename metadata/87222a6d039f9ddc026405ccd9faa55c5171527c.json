That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\nA lot of Shadows and Secrets and Shades and some War today. They seem to go together in a way. A way that just looks at the titles and not the content. Superficial, like me.\n\nI have decided on the makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are possible. I plan on 16 more. Most are 13-18gb. The Superman torrent will be around 35-38gb. The big Batman one was popular so I'll do the same with Superman.\n\n40 Sham-Spd\n41 Spe-Stq (Minus Star)\n42 Star*\n43 Str-Supera\n44 Superb-Supq (Minus Superman(Space or Dash) - #44 WILL include titles that start with Superman's\n45 Superman\n46 Supr-Td\n47 Te-Tn\n48 To-Unk\n49 Unl-Waq\n50 War-Wn\n51 Wonder*\n52 World*\n53 Wo-Z (Minus Wonder, World)\n54 Fill Torent A-D\n55 Fill Tor\n\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering:  DC from DC from Secret O-Shal\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nSince the secret origins comics are not a series, each having their own topic, I decided to list them individually so you can see what's there. I don't know what the big secret is. Why does every one have a &quot;Secret Origin&quot;. My origin, for one is not secret. Except from you\n\nSince these were published in years from 1961 to 1999, and history in a  comics universe is not fixed like it is in the s so-called real one they will not be consistent.\nLater ones will contradict earlier ones, some of the later ones will contradict post 1999 changes DC did, and with the reboot of the Universe, only what's in the &quot;new 52&quot; issues can be trusted as &quot;true in universe&quot;. \n\nThere's probably no way to know if our actual history has been ret-conned by some powerful alien with time travel, or likewise by a human from the future, or just by the action of natural forces we do not understand yet, or even know exist. Don't loose sleep over it. You can't do anything about it or make different choices because of it. So it makes no difference whether it's happening or not.  As Spock said, a difference which makes no difference *is* no difference. But Spock always was a bit of  a smart-ass.. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I like Spock, Spock was a childhood hero, but it would be hard to convince me that logic dictates you must correct people who state a number to a practical amount of precision by re-stating the figure to more precision than is useful. I'm 90% certain it does not.  Or as Spock would say  89.986579426% certain, to be precise.\n\nI think that would get pretty old after awhile.\n\n\nSecret Origin Mini Comics (8) (Leaf Candy(1980)\nThe Secret Origin of Aquaman (mini) (1980)\nThe Secret Origin of Batman (mini) (1980)\nThe Secret Origin of Green Lantern (mini) (1980)\nThe Secret Origin of Hawkman (mini) (1980)\nThe Secret Origin of Superman (mini) (1980)\nThe Secret Origin of Wonder Woman (mini) (1980)\nThe Secret Origin of the Flash (mini) (1980)\nThe Secret Origin of the Justice League of America (mini) (1980)\nSuper Heroes Collectors Album Secret Origin Stories (Leaf Candy(1980)\nThe Secret Origin of the Legion Clubhouse 12p (unpublished)\n\nSecret Origins 80-Page Giant-Young Justice (1998)\nSecret Origins Featuring The JLA TPB-unscanned.jpg\nSecret Origins Replica Edition-unscanned.jpg\nSecret Origins Special 001-Penguin Two Face Riddler (1989)\nSecret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant (1999)\nSecret Origins of the Super DC Heroes HC (Harmony(1976)\nSecret Origins of the World's Greatest Super-Heroes TPB (1990)\nSecret Origins of the World's Greatest Super-Heroes TPB Extra's Only\n\nSecret Origins v1 (1961)\n\nSecret Origins v2 01-07 (1973-1974)\nSecret Origins v2 001-Superman, Batman, Flash\nSecret Origins v2 002-Supergirl, GL(Hal), The Atom\nSecret Origins v2 003-Wonder Woman, Wildcat\nSecret Origins v2 004-Vigilante, Kid Eternity\nSecret Origins v2 005-Spectre\nSecret Origins v2 006-LSH, BlackHawk\nSecret Origins v2 007-Robin, Aquaman 36p ctc\n\nSecret Origins v3 01-50 (1986-1990)\nSecret Origins v3 001-Superman (Golden Age)\nSecret Origins v3 002-Blue Beetle\nSecret Origins v3 003-Shazam\nSecret Origins v3 004-Firestorm-The Nuclear Man\nSecret Origins v3 005-Crimson Avenger\nSecret Origins v3 006-Halo, Batman\nSecret Origins v3 007-Guy Gardner, Sandman\nSecret Origins v3 008-Shadow Lass, Doll Man\nSecret Origins v3 009-Star Spangled Kid, &amp; Flash (G.A.)\nSecret Origins v3 010-Phantom Stranger\nSecret Origins v3 011-Hawkman, Power Girl\nSecret Origins v3 012-Challengers of the Unknown\nSecret Origins v3 013-Nightwing, The Whip, Johnny Thunder\nSecret Origins v3 014-Suicide Squad\nSecret Origins v3 015-Deadman, The Spectre\nSecret Origins v3 016-Warlord, Hourman\nSecret Origins v3 017-Adam Strange, Dr. Occult\nSecret Origins v3 018-Green Lantern, The Creeper\nSecret Origins v3 019-Uncle Sam, Guardian\nSecret Origins v3 020-Batgirl, Dr. Mid-Nite\nSecret Origins v3 021-Jonah Hex, Black Condor\nSecret Origins v3 022-Millennium-Manhunters\nSecret Origins v3 023-Millennium-Floronic Man Guardians v3 of the Universe\nSecret Origins v3 024-Blue Devil, Dr Fate\nSecret Origins v3 025-LSH, The Atom\nSecret Origins v3 026-Black Lighting, Miss America\nSecret Origins v3 027-Zatara, Zatanna\nSecret Origins v3 028-Midnight, Nightshade\nSecret Origins v3 029-Power of the Atom, Mr America\nSecret Origins v3 030-Plastic Man, The Elongated Man\nSecret Origins v3 031-Justice Society of America\nSecret Origins v3 032-Justice League of America\nSecret Origins v3 033-Mr. Miracle, Fire, Icemaiden\nSecret Origins v3 034-Captain Atom, Rocket Red, Gnort\nSecret Origins v3 035-Martian Manhunter, Max Lord, Boster Gold\nSecret Origins v3 036-Green Lantern, Poison Ivy\nSecret Origins v3 037-Legion of Substitute Heroes, Doctor Light\nSecret Origins v3 038-Green Arrow, Speedy\nSecret Origins v3 039-Man-Bat, Animal Man\nSecret Origins v3 040-Gorilla Grodd, Congorilla\nSecret Origins v3 041-The Rogue's Gallery of the Flash\nSecret Origins v3 042-Phantom Girl, Grim Ghost\nSecret Origins v3 043-Hawk &amp; Dove\nSecret Origins v3 044-Batman vs. the Mudpack\nSecret Origins v3 045-Blackhawk, El Diablo\nSecret Origins v3 046-JLA, New Titans v3, LOSH\nSecret Origins v3 047-Chemical King, Ferro Lad, Karate Kid\nSecret Origins v3 048-Ambush Bug, Trigger Twins, Rex Stanley\nSecret Origins v3 049-Newsboy Legion, Bouncing Boy, Silent Knight\nSecret Origins v3 050-Batman, Robin, Flash, Johnny Thunder, Dolphin, Black Canary, Space Museum ctc\n\nSecret Origins v3 Annual 01-03 (1987-1989)\nSecret Origins Annual 001-Doom Patrol, Captain Comet ctc (1987)\nSecret Origins Annual 002-Flash II, Flash III, (1988)\nSecret Origins Annual 003-Teen Titans (1989)\n\nSecret Six v1 01-07 (1968-1969)\nSecret Six v2 01-06 (2006-2007)\nSecret Six v3 01-xx (2008-20xx)\n\nSecret Society of Super-Villains 01-17 (16-17 unpub)(1976-1978)\nSecret of The Swamp Thing TPB-unscanned.jpg\nSecrets of Haunted House 01-46 (1975-1982)\n\nYou might not be able to figure out what the original title of this was from the abbreviation. It was &quot;Sinister House of Secret Love&quot; for 4 issues. I Just love that title. So deliciously bizarre. Apparently the marketing guys at DC decided it would sell better if they took the love out. Its supposed to be sinister they said-  &quot;what's love got to do, got to do with it. Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken&quot;. \n\nSecrets of Sinister House 05-18-after Sin Hse of Secret Love 4 (1972-1974)\nSecrets of the Legion of Super Heroes 01-03 (1981)\nSeekers Into The Mystery 01-15 (Vertigo(1996-1997)\nSeige of the Zi Charam, The Complete-DCP Archive Edition 124p\nSeimaden v1-10 CMX Substitute (Carlsen Comics-scanlated\nSensation Comics 001-109 (1942-1952)\nSensation Comics Unpublished WW\nSensation Comics v2 001 ctc (1999)\nSensation Mystery 110-116 (After Sensation Comics 109 (1952-1953)\nSentences-The Life of M.F.

That was based on the 1955-59 TV series called &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; starring (get ready) the late Phil Silvers, who was a really funny guy. This comic is entirely unrelated, being instead an ahead-of-it's-time look at the stress and general emotional toll of war on the men and women who serve, little understood by the millions at home who have not experienced combat. It deals honestly and realistically with drug and alcohol problems, PSTD (then called &quot;battle fatigue&quot; or &quot;shell shock&quot;), the loneliness and fear that led many into infidelity and the struggles to reconcile that with the sincere love they had for their wives and husbands. It portrays the enemy in a sympathetic fashion, humanizing them, rather than reducing them to faceless, emotionless, evil fiends to be destroyed at any cost,  as the military and civilian leadership frequently would prefer the soldiers and the public to believe them to be. These books are not for the squeamish.They are not for those who prefer not to face the harsh and unpleasant truths about our own history. It may be that war is the only answer sometimes, these comics seem to say, but enter and and see the cost, lest you call for war lightly.\n\nNah, this is totally about the TV show, just for laughs. Go read some Vertigo (uggh!
