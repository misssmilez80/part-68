That is precisely why nothing is better suited for radio theater than a good ghost story...and we here in New England have plenty of them! True or not, believer or skeptic, nothing captures the imagination with such a cold, firm grasp as a tale of legend and mystery. We always &quot;want&quot; to believe, and the stories will give you cause to wonder. Some are pure legend, passed down for scores of decades, while others rest on foundations of fact, difficult to discredit or explain. You be the judge!\n\n&quot;The Lady in Black&quot; is the true story of the mournful ghost that haunts the fort on George's Island in Boston Harbor. \n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:822c033fa08a2ef671e22c7e1aad75a166e04284","amp;dn":"Candlelight+Tales%3A+The+Lady+in+Black++-++Jerry+Robbins+++%28Drama%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"822c033fa08a2ef671e22c7e1aad75a166e04284","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,44,3,63,160,138,46,246,113,226,44,126,26,173,117,161,102,224,66,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
