They soon met bassist Johnny Sinclair and formed the band, adding sisters Tamara and Natasha Amabile as backing vocalists. Their debut single, &quot;I'm an Adult Now,&quot; quickly became a smash hit across Canada in 1986, sparked by a low-budget video which made it onto the Canadian music video channel MuchMusic.\n\nThe band signed with manager Jeff Rogers (Swell) in 1986. However, the band did not immediately sign to a record label, but instead released another independent single, &quot;Killed by Love,&quot; in 1988. The Amabile sisters left the band that year, and were replaced by Kris Abbott and Leslie Stanwyck.\n\nIn 1988, they signed to Chrysalis Records. Their debut album, Love Junk, was produced by Todd Rundgren and released that year. &quot;I'm an Adult Now&quot; was re-recorded and released as a single again, making it to the charts a second time. In January 1989 the song peaked at #6 on the Billboard's Alternative songs chart.[2] It was followed by &quot;She's So Young&quot; and &quot;Hard To Laugh.&quot; The album sold over 100,000 copies in Canada, was certified platinum, and is considered one of the classics of Canadian rock.\nStanwyck and Sinclair left, going on to form Universal Honey, after completing the band's follow-up with Rundgren, 1990's One Sided Story. That album, led by the hit singles &quot;New Language&quot; and &quot;Two Girls in One,&quot; did not sell as well as Love Junk, but was still a significant hit for the band. Starting with the tour for the album, Brad Barker and Susan Murumets joined the lineup. Rachel Oldfield replaced Murumets in 1992.\n\nThe band then went through difficulties with their record label, but signed to Mercury Records for 1993's The Downward Road. Despite some success with the single &quot;Cigarette Dangles&quot; (the video appeared on Beavis and Butt-head), label troubles continued, and the band recorded their next two albums for the now-defunct Canadian label Iron Music. Oldfield left the band in 1995, and was replaced by Jennifer Foster, who in turn left the following year and was replaced by Renee Suchy.\n\nAlthough the group never officially disbanded, after 1996 they did not record as a unit until 2005, when they recorded two new tracks for a greatest hits compilation. The most recent lineup has played a few concerts over the last few years, culminating in a series of shows over the last week of 2005 which ended with a New Year's Eve concert in London, Ontario. In March 2006, they were inducted into the Canadian Indies Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLovejunk 1988\n\n\nLove Junk was the debut album by Canadian college rockers The Pursuit of Happiness, released in 1988. The album's biggest hit was &quot;I'm An Adult Now&quot;, although &quot;Hard to Laugh&quot; and &quot;She's So Young&quot; were also notable singles.\n\nThe 7&quot; single for &quot;She's So Young&quot; contains a (non-album) b-side track called &quot;Let My People Go&quot; which was later released on the Sex and Food: The Best of TPOH compilation.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Hard to Laugh&quot; (2:38)\n2.\t&quot;Ten Fingers&quot; (2:53)\n3.\t&quot;I'm an Adult Now&quot; (4:25)\n4.\t&quot;She's So Young&quot; (3:34)\n5.\t&quot;Consciousness Raising as a Social Tool&quot; (2:27)\n6.\t&quot;Walking in the Woods&quot; (3:51)\n7.\t&quot;Beautiful White&quot; (3:27)\n8.\t&quot;When the Sky Comes Falling Down&quot; (3:25)\n9.\t&quot;Looking for Girls&quot; (2:50)\n10.\t&quot;Man's Best Friend&quot; (2:35)\n11.\t&quot;Tree of Knowledge&quot; (3:50)\n12.\t&quot;Killed by Love&quot; (4:01)\n13.\t&quot;Down on Him&quot; (2:30), CD bonus track and appears on LP Chrysalis CJS-41675C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Sided Story 1990\n\n\nOne Sided Story was the second album by Canadian college rock band The Pursuit of Happiness, released in 1990.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Food&quot; (2:31)\n2.\t&quot;Two Girls in One&quot; (2:35)\n3.\t&quot;New Language&quot; (2:42)\n4.\t&quot;Something Physical&quot; (3:06)\n5.\t&quot;One Thing&quot; (2:58)\n6.\t&quot;No Safe Place&quot; (3:10)\n7.\t&quot;Shave Your Legs&quot; (2:49)\n8.\t&quot;Runs in the Family&quot; (3:04)\n9.\t&quot;All I Want&quot; (4:48)\n10.\t&quot;Forbidden Fruit&quot; (3:16)\n11.\t&quot;Little Platoons (My Neighbourhood)&quot; (2:51)\n12.\t&quot;Survival&quot; (5:05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Downward Road  1993\n\n\nThe Downward Road was the third album by Canadian power pop band The Pursuit of Happiness, released in 1993.
