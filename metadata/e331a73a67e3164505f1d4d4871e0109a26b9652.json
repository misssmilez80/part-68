Can Dawkins really despise that with all the passion he professes to hate religious dogma?\n\nDawkins insists that even Jesus would have plumped for atheism had he known what we now know. Harris and Dawkins place themselves on the latter's seven-point &quot;scale of belief&quot;. Turns out Harris is less sure of his atheism than Dawkins, for whom God is as likely to exist as &quot;fairies, pixies, and werewolves&quot;.\n\nHarris and Dawkins leave no stone unturned in this interview: the politics of religion; the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the UK; why our government won't debate faith schools; and how beleaguered US Bible belt atheists embrace Dawkins like a long-lost friend.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://richarddawkins.net/videos/643626-john-harris-s-national-conversations-podcast-richard-dawkins&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://richarddawkins.net/videos/643626-john-harris-s-national-conversations-podcast-richard-dawkins&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMore Atheist Torrents:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://feeds.feedburner.com/AtheistTorrents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://feeds.feedburner.com/AtheistTorrents&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTweet suggestions #AtheistTorrents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e331a73a67e3164505f1d4d4871e0109a26b9652","amp;dn":"John+Harris%5C%27s+national+conversations+podcast%3A+Richard+Dawkins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e331a73a67e3164505f1d4d4871e0109a26b9652","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,49,167,58,103,227,22,69,5,241,212,212,135,30,1,9,162,107,150,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
