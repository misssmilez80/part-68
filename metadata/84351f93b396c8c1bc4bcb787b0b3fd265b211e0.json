Not only is he an orphan with an unfortunate nose, but also he has narcolepsy, a condition that gives him terrible nightmares and makes him fall asleep at the worst possible moments. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sent to a new orphanage, where he encounters vicious bullies, selfish adults, strange circumstancesÃ¢â‚¬â€and a mystery that could change his life forever. Luckily, he has one important thing in his favor: HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a genius.\n \nOn his quest to solve the mystery, Nicholas finds enemies around every corner, but also friends in unexpected placesÃ¢â‚¬â€and discovers along the way that the greatest puzzle of all is himself.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84351f93b396c8c1bc4bcb787b0b3fd265b211e0","amp;dn":"Extraordinary+Education+of+Nicholas+Benedict","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84351f93b396c8c1bc4bcb787b0b3fd265b211e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,53,31,147,179,150,200,193,188,75,203,120,123,11,63,210,101,178,17,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
