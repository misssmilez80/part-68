Soren enjoys hearing stories of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole, a mythical group of warrior owls, who once saved all owlkind from the evil &quot;Pure Ones&quot;. His elder brother, Kludd, however, thinks Soren soft-headed for believing in such stories. One night, while branching, Kludd pushes Soren and loses his balance, too; and they both fall to the ground where they are attacked by a Tasmanian devil. They are then kidnapped by two owls, Jatt and Jutt and taken to St. Aegolious, the canyon home of the evil Pure Ones.\n\nThere, Soren meets an elf owl named Gylfie (Emily Barclay) and her captor, a boreal owl named Grimble. Nyra (Helen Mirren), second-in-command of the Pure Ones and mate of Metal Beak, claims that the owlets are now the Pure Ones' slaves. Soren and Gylfie protest and are sent to be pickers. Kludd denies his brother and goes away to be a soldier with other selected owls. They are tutored by Nyra in the ways of the Pure Ones, who believe that Tyto owls (barn owls and their relatives) are the strongest owls and that they have the right to rule the owl kingdoms. Meanwhile, The other captured owls are forced to sleep under the full moon, which causes &quot;moon-blinking&quot;, a trance-like state. Soren and Gylfie manage to stay awake so they will not be moon-blinked. They are brought to a large cavern to pick through owl pellets for small metal flecks, which causes excruciating pain in owls gizzards. Metal Beak conspires with one of his minions to lay a trap for the Guardians of Ga'Hoole. At the same time, Grimble secretly reveals to Soren and Gylfie that he is not truly a Pure One and that his family was captured and forced into their service. He teaches Soren and Gylfie to fly, so they can warn the Guardians of the Pure Ones' plans.\n\nKludd has become a strong soldier, and his promise prompts Nyra to ask him about Soren's potential. The Pure Ones find Grimble teaching Soren and Gylfie to fly, and Nyra attacks them. Kludd joins Nyra's, ignoring Soren's pleas. Grimble sacrifices himself to hold them back, and Soren and Gylfie barely escape to begin their quest. On their journey, they meet a burrowing owl named Digger; a Great Grey owl named Twilight; and Soren's old nestmaid, Ms. P. They join Soren and Gylfie on their quest.\n\n\n[ Info sul file ]\n\nNome: Il regno di ga'hoole.avi\nData: 20/09/2011 09:40:45\nDimensione: 1,483,616,256 bytes (1414.887 MB)\n\n[ Info generiche ]\n\nDurata: 01:32:50 (5570 s)\nTipo di contenitore: AVI OpenDML\nStreams totali: 3\nTipo stream n. 0: video\nTipo stream n. 1: audio\nTipo stream n. 2: audio\nAudio streams: 2\nISFT: VirtualDubMod 1.4.13\nINAM: Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole\nISBJ: Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole\nIART: Colleromito\nICOP: Colleromito\nICMT: www.nautilus-bt.org\nJUNK: VirtualDub build 14328/release\n\n[ Giudizi sulla qualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  ]\n\nRisoluzione: MEDIA (640 x 272)\nLarghezza: multipla di 32 (BENE)\nAltezza: multipla di 16 (BENE)\nQualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  DRF medio: MEDIA (3.327763)\nQualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  deviazione standard: ALTA (0.667380)\nMedia pesata dev. std.: ALTA (0.473918)\n\n[ Traccia video ]\n\nFourCC: divx/DX50\nRisoluzione: 640 x 272\nDisplay aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 25 fps\nFrames totali: 139250\nBitrate: 1348.380788 kbps\nQf: 0.309830\nMax key int: 250\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 1 ]\n\nAudio tag: 0x2000 (AC3)\nBitrate: 384 kbps CBR\nCanali: 5\nFrequenza: 48000 Hz\nStream size: 267,359,232 bytes\nRitardo: 0 ms\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 2 ]\n\nAudio tag: 0x2000 (AC3)\nBitrate: 384 kbps CBR\nCanali: 5\nFrequenza: 48000 Hz\nStream size: 267,359,232 bytes\nRitardo: 0 ms\n\n[ Info sulla codifica MPEG4 ]\n\nUser data: DivX503b2816p\nPacked bitstream: SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¬\nInterlaced: No\nAspect ratio: Square pixels\nQuant type: H.263\nFrames totali: 139250\nFrames corrotti: 0\n\nI-VOPs: 4868 (  3.496 %) #                       \nP-VOPs: 88260 ( 63.382 %) ################         \nB-VOPs: 46122 ( 33.122 %) ########                 \n\nMax consecutive B-VOPs: 1\n\n[ Analisi DRF ]\n\nDRF medio: 3.327763\nDeviazione standard: 0.667380\nDRF max: 6\n\nDRF=1:   116 (  0.083 %)                         \nDRF=2: 8642 (  6.206 %) ##                       \nDRF=3: 80448 ( 57.772 %) ##############           \nDRF=4: 47782 ( 34.314 %) #########               \nDRF=5:    53 (  0.038 %)                         \nDRF=6: 2209 (  1.586 %)                         \nDRF&gt;6:     0 (  0.000 %)                         \n\nRapporto generato da AVInaptic\n(26-05-2007) in data 20 set 2011, h 09:45:31\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bf853e326c1b70ad9de8da20a2c5b153247ac85","amp;dn":"Legend+of+the+Guardians+The+Owls+of+Ga+Hoole+%5BDivX+ITA+ENG%5D+naut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bf853e326c1b70ad9de8da20a2c5b153247ac85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,248,83,227,38,193,183,10,217,222,141,162,10,44,91,21,50,71,172,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
