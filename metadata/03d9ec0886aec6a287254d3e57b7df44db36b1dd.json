The show was written and directed by satirical humourist Jaspal Bhatti, who also played himself as the main character. His wife Savita Bhatti produced the show and also acted in all the episodes as his wife. The sitcom was a satire on the socio-cultural problems faced by the common man in India at the time. Although only 10 episodes of the show were ever produced, the show has had a long and powerful legacy.\nDirector: Jaspal Bhatti\nStars:         Jaspal Bhatti, Savita Bhatti and Payal Chaudhary\nimdb:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390705/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390705/&lt;/a&gt;                            \n\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/254/vlcsnap2011112614h55m53.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/254/vlcsnap2011112614h55m53.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/233/vlcsnap2011112614h56m05.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/233/vlcsnap2011112614h56m05.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/5/vlcsnap2011112614h56m49.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/5/vlcsnap2011112614h56m49.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/10/vlcsnap2011112614h57m36.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/10/vlcsnap2011112614h57m36.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                            \n\n         VISIT MY BLOG   or           for fb page links\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03d9ec0886aec6a287254d3e57b7df44db36b1dd","amp;dn":"Flop+show+%281989%29+all+10+episodes_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03d9ec0886aec6a287254d3e57b7df44db36b1dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,217,236,8,134,174,198,162,135,37,77,62,87,183,223,68,219,54,177,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
