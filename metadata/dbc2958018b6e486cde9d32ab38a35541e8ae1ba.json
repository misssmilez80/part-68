Pete McKell, a cynical American travel writer, joins a disparate group of holiday-makers on a river cruise through the waters of Kakadu National Park. Initially Pete clashes with their tour captain, Kate, a feisty young woman who assumes he is just another 'city-slicker' in search of a quick thrill. After an uneventful day cruising the river, Kate is reluctantly persuaded to steer their boat into unexplored territory. They discover a secluded lake but terror strikes when their craft receives a powerful blow from beneath the murky depths and begins to sink. With little choice, she beaches the vessel on the closest dry land -a tiny mud island. With a rising tide and only half an hour of daylight left, fear grips the group as they realize they are trapped in the lair of a 'rogue' crocodile.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479528/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479528/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbc2958018b6e486cde9d32ab38a35541e8ae1ba","amp;dn":"Rogue+%282007%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbc2958018b6e486cde9d32ab38a35541e8ae1ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,194,149,128,24,182,228,134,205,233,211,42,179,138,53,84,30,138,225,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
