We also note that at least Bill ClintonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mistress never agitated for foreign wars, while the mistress of neo-con favourite, UK Sec of Defense, Liam Fox is galavanting around the world with the Minister and stoking conflict.\n\nIn the second half of the show, Max Keiser interviews Michael Betancourt about the threat that Occupy Wall Street presents to our modern form of capitalism that relies on ignorance and passivity in the population in order to operate schemes of fraud and bubbles.        \n\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
