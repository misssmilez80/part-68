For .NET developers, especially, adopting these new approaches and the tools that support them can require rethinking the development process altogether.\n\nContinuous Integration in .NET is a tutorial for developers and team leads that teaches readers how to re-imagine their development strategy by creating a consistent continuous integration process. This book shows how to build on the tools they already know - .NET Framework and Visual Studio - and to use powerful software like MSBuild, Subversion, TFS 2010, Team City, CruiseControl.NET, NUnit, and Selenium.\nAbout the Author\n\nMarcin Kawalerowicz runs a consultancy in Silesia, Poland. He has more than 8 years experience in software development in fields ranging from automotive to finance.\n\nCraig Berntson, a 25-year veteran of the software industry, has been Microsoft MVP since 1996 and speaks regularly throughout the US, Canada, and Europe. He lives in Salt Lake City, UT.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 375 pages\n    * Publisher: Manning Publications; Pap/Psc edition (March 25, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1935182552\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1935182559","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e0820994076933c73921a9ec819b28b00071db2","amp;dn":"Continuous+Integration+in+.NET%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e0820994076933c73921a9ec819b28b00071db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,8,32,153,64,118,147,60,115,146,26,158,200,25,178,139,0,7,29,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
