I was introduced to this Anime on an Australian TV channel called AXN. It is my absolute favorite anime, and I was saddened to learn that it is almost unheard of in the U.S.  Upon urging from friends curious about it, I created this torrent for more people to know about it.\n\nSo here it goes.  This is in Japanese with English subtitles, it is actually a direct rip from TV, so it is not a fansub.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d272363454924958e29f20d8c854d0094484d84","amp;dn":"Shin+Hakkenden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d272363454924958e29f20d8c854d0094484d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,39,35,99,69,73,36,149,142,41,242,13,140,133,77,0,148,72,77,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
