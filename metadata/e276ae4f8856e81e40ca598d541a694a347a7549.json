Everything   \n         about this recipe is top secret, from the breading, to        \n         the sauce, to how to cut the onion. In order to really        \n         understand this recipe, Todd must find the man who            \n         first created the Bloomin' Onion, but he's not so easy        \n         to track down these days. Todd gets himself into a few        \n         hairy situations in his search for Outback's secrets but      \n         finds out more than he ever thought he would from some        \n         surprising sources. With all his knowledge gained, will       \n         Todd's version of the Bloomin' Onion be able to stand up      \n          against the real thing in a taste test?                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n         Hybrid.
