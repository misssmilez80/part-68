The game was developed by Telltale Games as part of a licensing deal with Universal Pictures. Bob Gale, co-creator, co-writer and co-producer of the film trilogy, assisted Telltale in writing the game's story, while both the original actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have allowed the developers to use their likenesses in the game for the lead characters Marty McFly and Doc Brown, respectively. Lloyd also provides the voice for Doc, while new talent AJ LoCascio plays the role of Marty; Fox later appeared to voice two cameo roles in the final episode.[5] The game is split up into five episodes available on multiple gaming platforms, the first episode released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X on December 22, 2010. PlayStation 3 and iPad versions followed February 15, 2011. Episodes 2 through 5 were released throughout February to June 2011, with the final episode being released on June 23, 2011. Telltale will be publishing the series as retail products for the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii consoles.\n\nBack to the Future: The Game is a graphic adventure game; the player controls Marty to explore the 3D environments using either the keyboard, mouse or game controller to move around. The player can have Marty examine objects, talk to non-player characters (initiating dialog through conversation trees), and perform specific actions in order to solve puzzles and progress the game. Some items can be picked up and stored in Marty's inventory, and then can be used later to interact with other characters or objects. The game provides a list of current goals for the player to complete to advance the game. The player can access a hint system, revealing one clue at a time from a number of cryptic clues for how to solve a specific puzzle.[7][8]\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\t\t      Recommended System Requirements:\nCPU:\t1.8 GHz Pentium 4 or equivalent\t      CPU: 2.7 GHz Pentium 4 or equivalent\nRAM:\t2 GB RAM\t\t              RAM:\t3 GB RAM\nVGA:\tATI or NVidia card w/ 256 MB RAM\t\tVGA:\tATI or NVidia card w/ 512 MB RAM\nDX:\tDirect X 9.0c\t\t              DX:\tDirect X 9.0c\nOS:\tXP Service Pack 3 / Vista / Windows 7 OS:\tXP Service Pack 3 / Vista / Windows 7\nHDD:\t2 GB Space Free\t\t              HDD:\t3 GB Space Free\nSound:\tDirect X 8.1 sound device             Sound:\tDirect X 8.1 sound device","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5493c79a3455a98ac9d9aa2152c436a8c4d84cbe","amp;dn":"Back+To+The+Future+The+Game+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5493c79a3455a98ac9d9aa2152c436a8c4d84cbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,147,199,154,52,85,169,138,201,217,170,33,82,196,54,168,196,216,76,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
