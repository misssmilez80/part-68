A central development in the last fifty years is the phenomenon of rigidity, whereby one can classify actions of certain groups, such as lattices in semi-simple Lie groups. This provides a way to classify all possible symmetries of important spaces and all spaces admitting given symmetries. Paradigmatic results can be found in the seminal work of George Mostow, Gergory Margulis, and Robert J. Zimmer, among others.\n\n\nThe papers in Geometry, Rigidity, and Group Actions explore the role of group actions and rigidity in several areas of mathematics, including ergodic theory, dynamics, geometry, topology, and the algebraic properties of representation varieties. In some cases, the dynamics of the possible group actions are the principal focus of inquiry. In other cases, the dynamics of group actions are a tool for proving theorems about algebra, geometry, or topology. This volume contains surveys of some of the main directions in the field, as well as research articles on topics of current interest.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 600 pages\n    * Publisher: University Of Chicago Press (April 30, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0226237885\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0226237886","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:939ad4971c4e8502fe1d4ad38f39f50d29fe36fe","amp;dn":"Geometry%2C+Rigidity+and+Group+Actions%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"939ad4971c4e8502fe1d4ad38f39f50d29fe36fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,154,212,151,28,78,133,2,254,29,74,211,143,57,245,13,41,254,54,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
