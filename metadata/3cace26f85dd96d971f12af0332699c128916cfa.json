Howlin' At the Moon\n\n\nTexas Jake (r.n Jake Lee aka King of Slide) is an exceptional blues and slide guitar player. \n\nHe writes songs that evoke true blues styles and traditions in each and every aspect. There are some real stompin blues tunes too in his catalog that sound every bit like the classics the rest of his songs do but that shouldn't come as much of a surprise. Jake's been 'at it' since he was thirteen years old and since then he's been involved in the business of writing, performing, and playing 'from the heart - making music the best it can be' all over the States in particular. As a guitarist, he's a difficult act to beat; there's some exquisite picking combined with the most astonishing slide phrases you're ever likely to hear from the genre that lead us to R&amp;B and Rock n Roll.
