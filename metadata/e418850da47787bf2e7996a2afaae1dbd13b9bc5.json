Written by George Eliot; Full-cast dramatisation starring Anna Chancellor, Michael Perceval-Maxwell and James Bryce; Dramatised by Robert Forrest.\n\nGwendolen Harleth is poised at the roulette-table, prepared to throw away her family fortune. She is observed by Daniel Deronda, a young man groomed in the finest tradition of the English upper-classes. And while Gwendolen loses everything and becomes trapped in an oppressive marriage, Deronda's fortunes take a different turn. After a dramatic encounter with the young Jewish woman Mirah, he becomes involved in a search for her lost family and finds himself drawn into ever-deeper sympathies with Jewish aspirations and identity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e418850da47787bf2e7996a2afaae1dbd13b9bc5","amp;dn":"George+Eliot+-+Daniel+Deronda+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e418850da47787bf2e7996a2afaae1dbd13b9bc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,24,133,13,164,119,135,191,46,121,150,162,175,170,225,219,209,59,155,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
