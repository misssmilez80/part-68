Everett Evans , Ray Bradbury , Bill Mills \nLength: 50 minutes\n\n\nEven death could not end their love....Dramatized for the first time ever in audio!\n\nSummary\nHere is an all-new, full-scale audio production of prize-winning fantasist E. Everett Evans' legendary off-trail romantic horror tale &quot;The Undead Die&quot; (written in collaboration with Ray Bradbury).\n\nYou will think you are listening to classic radio drama, or the soundtrack for a lost 1940s horror film. This new audio dramatization is read and performed by a full cast with a lush, eerie and evocative music score and realistic sound effects. With the addition of an informative introduction written for this production by Jean Marie Stine, the total package is a real treat for aficionados of terror and the supernatural.\n\nBut, be warned: Evans' dark tale is a little gem, built around an original idea and treatment, that reaches an unexpected and affecting ending. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72e6e8ca40173ea1963af040450f422b17f69360","amp;dn":"The+Undead+Die++%28Drama%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72e6e8ca40173ea1963af040450f422b17f69360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,230,232,202,64,23,62,161,150,58,240,64,69,15,66,43,23,246,147,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
