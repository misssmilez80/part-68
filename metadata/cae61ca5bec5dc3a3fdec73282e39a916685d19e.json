Each chapter opens with background information on a specific aspect of ancient Greece and is followed by related activities that help students understand key ideas presented in the chapter. The first chapter aims to give students an understanding of where Greece is located and how the ancient civilization developed there. The subsequent chapters highlight details of Greek culture and everyday life: how people dressed, what they ate, how they entertained themselves, what they thought about, and how they ran their governments.\n\nAs you lead students through their study of ancient Greece, be sure to use the enclosed fold-out map, which shows the extent of GreeceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s political domain around 500 B.C.
