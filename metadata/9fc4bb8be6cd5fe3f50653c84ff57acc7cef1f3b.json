The DVD itself doesn't say anything about specific processors, so I think it works with all the whole Atom series as long as it is a Gigabyte motherboard. This is version 1.1. You just mount the .iso (with DAEMON Tools Lite) and you can install. If the autorun does not work just open the &quot;GSetup.exe&quot;  and then you can install all the drivers. You do need this to make my Windows XP computer connect to the internet if you format you hard drive.\n\nIs it Windows 7 Compatible?                        : Yes\nIs it Windows XP Compatible?                       : Yes\nIs it Windows Vista Compatible?                    : Yes\nWhat types of drivers are included?                : Chipsets, Serial-ATA, Raid, Network, Audio \nAny Junkware included on DVD?                      : Norton, Adobe Acrobat (You don't have to install them) \n\n\nDon't know how to mount .iso or burn DVD?\nMount (no physical DVD): 1. Download the latest lite version here : http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon\n2. Install of course\n3. Click &quot;add image&quot; and browse to the .iso\n4. Drag the file from the image catalog down to the drive on the bottom\n5. That is all\n\nBurn to DVD:\n1.
