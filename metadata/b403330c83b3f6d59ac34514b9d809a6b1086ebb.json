This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 9 - Monday - Three contestants from the Invention Test must face a Pressure Test like no other. The contestants have two hours to make a cake specially created by renowned Pastry Chef Vincent Gadan. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b403330c83b3f6d59ac34514b9d809a6b1086ebb","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E50.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b403330c83b3f6d59ac34514b9d809a6b1086ebb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,3,51,12,131,179,246,213,154,195,69,20,185,216,9,166,177,8,110,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
