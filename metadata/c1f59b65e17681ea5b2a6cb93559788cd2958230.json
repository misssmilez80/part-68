The modern world is connected through large-scale, computational networked systems such as the Internet and because of the ever-advancing technology of networking, efficient algorithms have become increasingly necessary to solve some of the problems developing in this area.   This work focuses on computational issues arising from the process of optimizing network routes, such as the quality of resulting links and their reliability. Algorithms are key to understanding the protocols underlying multicast routing. The main objective in the text is to derive efficient algorithms, with or without the guarantee of approximation, that can be applied to address these problems.
