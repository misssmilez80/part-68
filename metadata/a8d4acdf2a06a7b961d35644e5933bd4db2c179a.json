It wil cover the wealth of recent developments of Lukasiewicz Logic and their algebras (Chang MV-algebras), with particular reference to (de Finetti) coherent evaluation of continuously valued events, (Renyi) conditionals for such events, related algorithms.\nFrom the Back Cover\nIn recent years, the discovery of the relationships between formulas in Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ukasiewicz logic and rational polyhedra, Chang MV-algebras and lattice-ordered abelian roups, MV-algebraic states and coherent de FinettiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s assessments of continuous events, has changed the study and practice of many-valued logic. This book is intended as an up-to-date monograph on inÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½nite-valued Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ukasiewicz logic and MV-algebras. Each chapter features a combination of classical and reÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬cent results, well beyond the traditional domain of algebraic logic: among others, a comprehensive account is given of many eÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬ective procedures that have been reÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬cently developed for the algebraic and geometric objects represented by formulas in Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ukasiewicz logic. The book embodies the viewpoint that modern Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ukasiewicz logic and MV-algebras provide a benchmark for the study of several deep mathematical probÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬lems, such as RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyi conditionals of continuously valued events, the many-valued generalization of CarathÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©odory algebraic probability theory, morphisms and invariÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ant measures of rational polyhedra, bases and Schauder bases as jointly reÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½nable partitions of unity, and ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½rst-order logic with [0,1]-valued identity on Hilbert space. Complete versions are given of a compact body of recent results and techniques, proving virtually everything that is used throughout, so that the book can be used both for individual study and as a source of reference for the more advanced reader.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 274 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (July 1, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 9400708394\n    * ISBN-13: 978-9400708396","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8d4acdf2a06a7b961d35644e5933bd4db2c179a","amp;dn":"Advanced+Ukasiewicz+Calculus+and+MV-Algebras+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8d4acdf2a06a7b961d35644e5933bd4db2c179a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,212,172,223,42,6,167,185,97,211,86,68,229,147,59,212,219,44,23,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
