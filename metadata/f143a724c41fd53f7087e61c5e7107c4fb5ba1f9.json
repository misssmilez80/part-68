The 1995 death of lead vocalist Shannon Hoon halted the band's activity, and the members went on hiatus until officially disbanding in 1999. The band reformed with new lead vocalist Travis Warren in 2006, and although Warren departed two years later, he has since resumed performing with the band.\n\nIt's possible that Blind Melon is some form of reference to the 1920s' Blues artist Blind Lemon Jefferson. Cheech &amp; Chong had an act involving a character named Blind Melon Chitlin [1] which was itself a reference to Blind Lemon. Another story states that the band took its name from the bassist Brad's father, who teased the band calling them &quot;Blind Melons&quot;.[2] Even if this story is the true inspiration, the possibility that the father took the reference from either the early blues artist or the skit in parody of him still exists. The reference to Blind Lemon Jefferson also fits the band's blues-influenced style.\n\nBlind Melon formed in California in 1989, with members from Indiana, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania. The band signed to Capitol Records in 1991 and recorded an unreleased demo. The band's initial popularity is partially attributed to vocalist Hoon's association with Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose, and Hoon's backing vocals on several Guns N' Roses tracks on 1991's Use Your Illusion album (one example being &quot;Don't Cry&quot;).[3]\n\nThe band's self-titled debut album, produced by Rick Parashar (Pearl Jam), contained 13 songs and sold poorly until the &quot;No Rain&quot; single was released in September 1993. The single, promoted by a music video featuring the &quot;Bee Girl&quot; (played by Heather DeLoach), helped launch the commercial success of the band, eventually leading the album to quadruple-platinum status, debuting in the Billboard top 40 on 10/9/93 and peaking at #11 on the Hot 100.\n\nIn 1994, the band began recording its second album, Soup, in New Orleans with producer Andy Wallace. In August, the band went to perform at Woodstock 94, and had a positive performance. The band opened for the Rolling Stones' Voodoo Lounge Tour that fall. Soup was released in 1995, and predominantly featured shorter songs with a less conventional alternative rock approach. The lyrics to &quot;St. Andrew's Fall&quot; referenced a suicide jump, while &quot;New Life&quot; discussed the forthcoming birth of Hoon's child. &quot;Mouthful of Cavities&quot; featured backing vocals from Jena Kraus, who subsequently recorded a solo record with Christopher Thorn and Brad Smith. Possibly because of the more experimental sound (the album begins and ends with New Orleans style jazz and has a hodgepodge of instrumentation throughout), the album failed to meet sales expectations.\n\nIn 1995, Blind Melon contributed a version of the song &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; to the Encomium tribute album to Led Zeppelin, as well as a promotional CD with a cover of the Schoolhouse Rock! song &quot;Three Is a Magic Number&quot;.\n\nTheir version of &quot;Three Is a Magic Number&quot;, although never a charting single, became a fan favorite and features in the films Never Been Kissed, Slackers, and You, Me and Dupree as well as the retrospective The Best of Blind Melon.[4] All Music Guide reviewer Theresa E. LaVeck praised the tune's &quot;'70s feel-good vibe&quot; and &quot;rolling jam-band rhythms&quot;.[5]\n\nAgainst the advice of Hoon's drug counselor, Blind Melon went on tour in support of Soup. Hoon was found dead on the band's tour bus of a heart attack, caused by a cocaine overdose, on October 21, 1995 in New Orleans.\n\nThe remaining members released Nico (named for Hoon's daughter, only 13 weeks old when her father died) in 1996, with the profits going to a program that helps musicians with drug and alcohol addiction. Nico contained unreleased songs from the Soup recording sessions, as well as other songs often recorded with only partial instrumentation. The closing track, &quot;Letters from a Porcupine&quot;, was recorded as a telephone message left by Hoon on Thorn's answering machine. Nico included covers of Steppenwolf and John Lennon songs.\n\nDuring this period, without Hoon, the relationships between the band's main members disintegrated as they attempted to recruit a new front man. Rumors began to spread of a breakup and while efforts were made to reconcile, a split seemed likely.\n\nBlind Melon officially disbanded on March 4, 1999 and the various members went on to other projects.\n\nIn 2002, Capitol Records released a Classic Masters CD showcasing twelve Blind Melon songs. Thanks to stronger-than-expected sales, the band released The Best of Blind Melon in 2005, a CDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“DVD package that features Blind Melon performing live from a September 1995 concert in Chicago. On December 15, 2006, a tribute album to Blind Melon was released by Yakmusic in New Zealand featuring bands from all over the world. In April 2006, Capitol Records released the Live at the Palace CD that was re-released October 17, 2006 with a new package.\n\nOn September 15, 2006, it was announced that Blind Melon had reunited, with the addition of new lead singer Travis Warren (formerly of Rain Fur Rent).[6] On November 9, 2006 three new Blind Melon songs were released: &quot;Make a Difference&quot;, &quot;For My Friends&quot; and &quot;Harmful Belly&quot;. On October 7, 2007 Blind Melon performed their first show in twelve years in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nOn April 22, 2008, the band released For My Friends on Adrenaline Records.[7] The first single, &quot;Wishing Well&quot;, was released on March 4, 2008. A U.S. tour in support of the album began February 28. Around this time, Billboard confirmed that a book about the Hoon era of the band is forthcoming.[8] Then, on September 17, 2008, the book A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other: The Story of Shannon Hoon and Blind Melon by Greg Prato was published.[9]\n\nIn September 2008, Blind Melon played a number of European tour dates, with Warren as lead vocalist. On November 6, 2008, the band announced the departure of Warren. The reasons behind his departure are disputed: Warren states that he was ejected from the band after having lost his voice due to extensive touring[citation needed], while the band cites unresponsiveness and lack of communication and that Warren chose to leave the band on his own.[10] Initially, the band intended to honour their remaining dates, and announced Chris Shinn of Unified Theory as lead vocalist for the remainder of their tour. However, this was later retracted, and the tour cancelled, with the band stating that Shinn simply didn't have enough time to prepare.\n\nAfter clearing the air with the rest of the band, Warren returned to perform a previously scheduled gig with Blind Melon on December 31, 2008 in Dearborn, Michigan, which the band later announced would be the last show with him.[11]\n\nBlind Melon have stated their intention to continue looking for a permanent vocalist and carry on regardless. \n\n\n\n\n\nTones Of Home - The Best of Blind Melon 2005\n\n\nTones Of Home: The Best of Blind Melon is a compilation album by the band Blind Melon released on September 27, 2005.
