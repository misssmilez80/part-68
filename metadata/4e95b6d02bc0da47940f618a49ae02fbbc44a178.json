Immediately they are further sent to Romulus, where a new praetor, Shinzon, a half-Reman cloned from Captain Picard, appears to want peace with the Federation. But then the crew detects a break-in on their computer systems, and Picard is captured by the Romulans because Shinzon needs him as his only matching supplier of genetic material. Picard and the Enterprise can escape, only to find themselves battling Shinzons completely cloaked Warbird, who is after the complete destruction of earth. \n\n\n\nGeneral Information\n\nRelease Date: 05/02/2003\nSource: DVD\nTheater Date: 12/13/2002\nRuntime: 116 MiN 26 SEC\nDVD Date: 05/20/2003\nSubs: English\nVideo Codec: XViD\nVideo Bitrate: ~1224 kbps\nAudio Codec: AC3 5Ch\nAudio Bitrate: 448kbps 48kHz\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35\nResolution: 640x272\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nGenre: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi\nIMDB Rating: 6.5/10\nFiles: 700+699MB: 100x15MB\nIMDB Link:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://us.imdb.com/Title?0253754&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://us.imdb.com/Title?0253754&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e95b6d02bc0da47940f618a49ae02fbbc44a178","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Nemesis+2003+DVDRiP+XviD-DEiTY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e95b6d02bc0da47940f618a49ae02fbbc44a178","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,149,182,208,43,192,218,71,148,15,97,138,73,174,2,251,188,68,161,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
