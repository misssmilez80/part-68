Within five feet of you are dozensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if not hundredsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½of manufactured products that you interact with every day. If you are at work, perhaps there is a laptop, a stapler, a No. 2 pencil, a paperclip, a mobile phone, a coffee mug, a pushpin or an ergonomic chair. At home there may be a flat-screen TV, a pair of boots, a razor or a kitchen utensil. All told, we each touch or otherwise interact with an average of 600 manufactured objects every day.\n\nWe rarely consider where the objects that populate our lives were made or who dreamed them up in the first place. Yet our relationship with the manmade objects around us is complex, sometimes conflicted and often profound.\n\nOBJECTIFIED, by filmmaker Gary Hustwit, is the second installment in his trilogy on design (his first was Helvetica). OBJECTIFIED encourages us to stop and notice our surroundings and to think critically about creativity and consumption. Who makes all these objects, and why do they look and feel the way they do? How can good design make these thingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and by extension our livesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½better? What about the environment and the social and environmental costs associated with global manufacturing and planned obsolescence?\n\nFeaturing interviews with some of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s preeminent industrial and product designers, OBJECTIFIED is an exploration of the process at work behind everything from toothbrushes to tech gadgets. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about the designers who reexamine, reevaluate and reinvent our manufactured environment daily. It is about personal expression, identity, consumerism and sustainability. What can we learn about who we are and who we want to be from the objects with which we surround ourselves?\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: x264\nVideo Bitrate: 2283 kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nFramerate: 29.97 fps\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: ~170 kbps 48 KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nAudio Language: English\nRun-Time: 56:30\nSize: 922MB\nSource: 1080i OTA ATSC\nEncoded by: joeyjoejoe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0832264639310b2de0874673bd4dfc163c2e256","amp;dn":"PBS.Independent.Lens.Objectified.2009.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.Foru","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0832264639310b2de0874673bd4dfc163c2e256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,131,34,100,99,147,16,178,222,8,116,103,59,212,223,193,99,194,226,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
