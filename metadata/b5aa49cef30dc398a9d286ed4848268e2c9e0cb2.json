They both met as freshman and worked together in the band Break Before Dawn - both of which they are active members in - and they frequently would improvise together while waiting for rehearsals. This impromptu musical musing led them to create a softer and more ambient project together that would allow them to see what they wanted to see and hear what they wanted to hear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5aa49cef30dc398a9d286ed4848268e2c9e0cb2","amp;dn":"Production+Demos+-+Bandits+and+Rebels+320+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5aa49cef30dc398a9d286ed4848268e2c9e0cb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,170,73,206,243,13,195,152,169,210,134,237,72,72,38,142,44,158,12,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
