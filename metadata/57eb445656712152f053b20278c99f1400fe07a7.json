Put the files into the &quot;bin&quot; folder, in the game directory.\n\nRun the game.\n\nNOTE: If you get a &quot;cannot open fsgame.ltx&quot; error after this, take the &quot;runCS.bat&quot; file, and put it into the main game directory folder. Use this file to run the game.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nNote: I would highly recommend using the &quot;Clear Sky Complete&quot; modification with this game, it makes the experience much better.\n\n\n\nIf you like the game, support the developers, go out and buy it! GSC is one of the few remaining game developers who do such a good job with PC games.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57eb445656712152f053b20278c99f1400fe07a7","amp;dn":"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.+-+Clear+Sky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57eb445656712152f053b20278c99f1400fe07a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,235,68,86,86,113,33,82,240,83,178,2,120,201,159,20,0,254,7,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
