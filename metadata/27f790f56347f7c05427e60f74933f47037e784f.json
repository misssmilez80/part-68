His pregnant wife was brutally murdered by a Manson-like gang of hippy psychopaths during the 1960s. He becomes a virtual recluse - until years later he directs his own snuff inspired movies. He invites actors to take part in an audition at his country manor house - blurring the lines of what is real and what is fiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27f790f56347f7c05427e60f74933f47037e784f","amp;dn":"Snuff+Movie+%282005%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27f790f56347f7c05427e60f74933f47037e784f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,247,144,245,99,71,247,192,84,39,230,15,116,147,63,71,3,126,120,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
