She arrives expecting a stodgy old academic, but Ian is young, and the two are immediately attracted to one other. That complication quickly pales when Randi spends a night camping on the moors and is bitten by a werewolf. For the rest of the series, Randi and Ian investigate supernatural phenomena together while they search for a cure for Randi's curse. Eventually, their search takes them from British academia to American TV, when they move back to Randi's native California, and Ian becomes host of a trashy TV talk show focusing on psychic phenomena. The series was an old-style romantic comedy with a touch of horror.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a409fbf0e58a7dea1d5a57df406ece1d50eed8c1","amp;dn":"SheWolf+of+London+-+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a409fbf0e58a7dea1d5a57df406ece1d50eed8c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,9,251,240,229,138,125,234,29,90,87,223,64,110,206,29,80,238,216,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
