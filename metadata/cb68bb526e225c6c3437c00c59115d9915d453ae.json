His experience shines through on ''One Man Mutiny,'' his most textured and balanced work to date. Filled with slide guitar-laden riff rockers and lush ballads alike, Tommy shows that he is at his best when he's in the driver's seat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb68bb526e225c6c3437c00c59115d9915d453ae","amp;dn":"Tominson+-+2011+-+One+Man+Mutiny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb68bb526e225c6c3437c00c59115d9915d453ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,104,187,82,110,34,92,108,52,55,192,12,89,17,93,153,21,212,83,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
