In 90 minutes we see how pressure within a family can spiral out of control. What raises the drama considerably is the portrayal of the two brothers - both excellent. Bryan, uncertain in the face of his younger brother's role as the favoured son. The interaction between the two is superb. For both Thomas Wilson Brown and Andrew Bednarski, these roles are probably their best in terms of performance and in terms of appearance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9234da6fcbedcc8ee127a5eb00f8dd6a436a60a3","amp;dn":"%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5+%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%B8+%2F+Family+Sins+%281987%29+%D0%A1%D0%A8%D0%90+SAT-Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9234da6fcbedcc8ee127a5eb00f8dd6a436a60a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,52,218,111,203,237,204,142,225,39,165,235,0,248,221,106,67,106,96,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
