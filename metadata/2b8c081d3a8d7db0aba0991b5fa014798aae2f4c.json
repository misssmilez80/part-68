Despite the Israeli government's efforts to confiscate all of the footage taken during the attack, CULTURES OF RESISTANCE filmmaker Iara Lee was able to smuggle one hour of footage back to the United States.\n\n\nFrom the filmmaker: \n\n&quot;My name is Iara Lee. I am a dual U.S.-Brazilian citizen of Korean descent. I am a filmmaker and a human rights activist. &quot;I decided to join the Freedom Flotilla after going to Gaza a few months ago and seeing first hand the devastation there. After hearing the pleas of the people living in Gaza to have the blockade lifted, I felt I must do something. \n\n&quot;The Gaza Freedom Flotilla was on a humanitarian mission. We expected to be deterred from delivering our aid to Gazans, but we did not expect to be attacked. \n\n&quot;We started filming from the moment we boarded the Mavi Marmara right through the Israeli assault on the ship. Although all of our equipment was confiscated, we managed to smuggle this footage out. \n\n&quot;Mine is high-definition footage of the Flotilla attack and also the only sustained footage of the ship and its passengers preceding the deadly Israeli commando raid. Watching this raw, unedited footage, you will get a sense of the mood on the ship and of the passengers on it. \n\n&quot;Undoubtedly, many of you will be scrutinizing it for clues to resolve the mysteries that still surround what happened that fateful night. \n\n&quot;During this past week the Israeli government has repeatedly alleged that these passengers -- or some of them -- laid a trap for Israel, duped the Israeli military, and plotted a lynching. Israel has repeatedly alleged that we were anti-Semitic Muslim fanatics connected to terrorist organizations. \n\n&quot;In fact, the passengers on our mission came from many countries and religious and ethnic backgrounds. Our one common denominator was that we wanted to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza by highlighting the injustice of Israel's blockade. \n\n&quot;Prime Minister Netanyahu said, &quot;This wasn't the 'love boat,' this was a flotilla of terror supporters.&quot; Our footage will help you decide whether we were a love boat or a hate boat. You will see secular and devout passengers. You will see people at prayer and people working at their laptops. \n\n&quot;Was this a lynch-mob moved by hatred of Israelis or was it a cross-section of humanity moved by the plight of Gaza? Did we lay a trap for the Israeli commandos or did they unnecessarily attack us? Did we take them by surprise or did they take us by surprise? &quot;Do you see a premeditated ambush, or do you see some passengers using items at hand to protect themselves from an unprovoked assault by heavily armed commandos? \n\n&quot;You decide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b8c081d3a8d7db0aba0991b5fa014798aae2f4c","amp;dn":"Israel+attacks+Turkish+Gaza+aid+ship+1+hour+MKV+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b8c081d3a8d7db0aba0991b5fa014798aae2f4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,140,8,29,58,141,125,176,171,160,153,27,95,160,20,121,138,174,47,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
