La Rue's insistent beats, punchy arrangements and sometimes clever plays on words (&quot;Indiscreet&quot; or &quot;In The Street&quot; he asks in a song about the nature of hot gay romance in the pre-AIDS era) keep the set listenable throughout. &quot;Don't Keep in the Shadows&quot; is a duet with early 60s falsetto pop heartthrob Lou Christie. Apart from a few minor dance hits during the disco era, La Rue did not make it big, but in hindsight he looks like a pioneer in the field of openly gay music.
