Added a menu with options for opening your single-player world\n\n2. The multi-player menu now scans for LAN servers (single-player worlds)\n\n3. Villagers will remove trade options after the option has been used 3-15 times\n\n4. Added wooden stairs for the remaining three wood types\n\n5. Corrected Ender Chest storage (no longer whiped on respawning)\n\n6. A lot of smaller changes and fixes\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nINSTALL INTRUCTIONS \n\n\nWindows- \n\n1. Type %appdata% in the search bar \n\n2. .minecraft/bin\n\n3. Drag/Copy the new minecraft.jar file into /bin folder and replace it.\n\n4. Make a new folder named &quot;server&quot; .minecraft/server in that folder drag/copy the minecraft_server.jar file \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMAC - \n\n1. goto Finder/User/Library/Application Support/minecraft \n\n2. FOLLOW STEPS 2-4 above.\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43668195beecaada67411ac4f9ef804b20fbc731","amp;dn":"Minecraft+1.3+%5B+PreRelease+9+%5D+12w25a+-+JKoop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43668195beecaada67411ac4f9ef804b20fbc731","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,102,129,149,190,236,170,218,103,65,26,196,249,239,128,75,32,251,199,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
