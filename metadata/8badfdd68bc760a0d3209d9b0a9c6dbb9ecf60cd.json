Driver and Bittersweet Motel featured Trey on acoustic guitar. Moma Dance included Monkey Man (Rolling Stones) teases. The Harpua narration picked up where the December 6, 1996 Harpua ended; Jimmy hitched a ride from Vegas to Salt Lake City and the driver was playing Dark Side of the Moon. Dark Side was reportedly chosen the day of the show, partially based on sluggish ticket sales for this one venue compared to the rest of the tour. All the Dark Side songs were Phish debuts except for Great Gig (last played July 5, 1994, or 331 shows), although the original album version of Speak to Me was piped through the P.A. on Halloween, 1994 and Breathe was jammed on October 25, 1995. Smells Like Teen Spirit was also a Phish debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8badfdd68bc760a0d3209d9b0a9c6dbb9ecf60cd","amp;dn":"Phish+1998-11-02+%28Pink+Floyd+Musical+Costume%29+320k+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8badfdd68bc760a0d3209d9b0a9c6dbb9ecf60cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,173,253,214,139,199,96,160,211,32,157,155,10,156,109,187,158,207,96,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
