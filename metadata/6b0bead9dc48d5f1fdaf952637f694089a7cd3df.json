Alex calls in on the dubious Iran assassination provocation and other topics. \n\nFormer State Department official and author Steve Pieczenik and Prison Planet.com editor and journalist Paul Joseph Watson also talk about the possibility of war as the Obama administration makes a transparently bogus case against Iran. \n\nMike interviews Leslie Botha, V.P. of Public Relations with Sane Vax Inc., about Gov. Jerry Brown's poisoning of California's children. \n\nMike also talks with Mike Bundrant about the neuroscience of &quot;unrealistic optimism&quot; and Mark Kastel of the Cornucopia Institute about new findings on GMOs now included in &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; cereals.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
