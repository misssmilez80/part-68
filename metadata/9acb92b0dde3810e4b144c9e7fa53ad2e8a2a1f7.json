It depicts Keith's life in North Borneo in the period immediately before the Japanese invasion in 1942, and her subsequent internment and suffering, separated from her husband Harry, and with a young son to care for. Keith was initially interned at Berhala Island near Sandakan, but spent most of her captivity at Batu Lintang camp at Kuching, Sarawak. The camp was liberated in September, 1945.\nAdapted and produced by Nunnally Johnson, directed by Jean Negulesco, the film starred Claudette Colbert in the lead role. The New York Times reviewer said, &quot;It will shock you, disturb you, tear your heart out. But it will fill you fully with a great respect for a heroic soul.&quot;\nThe film is now in the public domain and so is available to watch in its entirety online at no charge.\nA second unit filmed locations in Borneo for four weeks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9acb92b0dde3810e4b144c9e7fa53ad2e8a2a1f7","amp;dn":"Three+came+home","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9acb92b0dde3810e4b144c9e7fa53ad2e8a2a1f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,203,146,176,221,227,129,14,75,20,76,158,127,165,58,210,232,162,161,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
