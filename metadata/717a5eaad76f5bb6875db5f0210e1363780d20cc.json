But what is the greatest comedy sketch of them all? \n\nChannel 4 counts down from 50 to one to reveal what the British public has voted \nas the best comedy sketch of all time. Will Bo Selecta's &quot;Michael Jackson's \nCrib&quot; sketch top Goodness Gracious Me's &quot;Going for an English&quot;? Does The Two \nRonnies &quot;Four Candles&quot; sketch triumph over Acorn Antiques by Victoria Wood and \nJulie Walters? Or could Pete and Dud's &quot;Dagenham Dialogues&quot; secure victory? \n\nThe programme traces the history of British comedy through some of the most \nbrilliantly crafted comic moments ever produced. But it remains to be seen \nwhether the sketches of comedy days gone by can match the popularity of more \nrecent favourites. \n\nNarrated by Tom Baker, 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches features interviews with a \nrange of the industry's finest, as they recount their personal favourite British \ncomedy sketches. The line-up includes John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin, \nMike Myers, Meera Syal, Griff Rhys Jones, The League of Gentlemen, Tony \nRobinson, Little Britain's Matt Lucas and David Walliams, Peep Show's David \nMitchell and Robert Webb, Father Ted writer Graham Linehan and many more.\n\n50 Greatest Comedy Sketches\n\n  01.
