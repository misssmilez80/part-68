Rachael Taylor (Bottle Shock, Cedar \n         Boys) and Alex Dimitriades (Head On) star in the romantic drama, \n         supported by a strong ensemble cast including Susie Porter, Angus \n         Sampson, Nathan Phillips, Cassandra Magrath and Jacki Weaver.Having \n         grown up with her mother in Nevada, Heidi hasn't spoken to her \n         father since she was seven. Now a young woman, haunted by his\n          memory, she returns to Australia seeking closure. Travelling to \n          her hometown, Heidi is forced to busk for cash and her melancholic \n          violin score catches the attention of handsome orange picker \n          Michael, who offers Heidi a ride. Both are initially guarded, \n          but an unexpected connection soon blossoms.Fleeing to Michael's \n          orange grove after a family reunion turns sour, Heidi finds the \n          escape and camaraderie she desperately needs. Whilst Michael \n          seems conflicted over Heidi's presence, it's picking season and\n           he is soon immersed in the colourful surrounds and offbeat \n           characters of the arriving citrus pickers. However, when Heidi \n           drops her guard and allows her feelings to flourish, Michael \n           struggles to reciprocate, his wit and charm masking a tortured \n           soul. As the past unravels, Michael and Heidi are forced to \n           confront the future, discovering that their lives and secrets \n           are better shared.\n           \n                                                                                \n          CAST \n\n\n\t  \t\t\t\n\n            NOTES               \n\n       \n           \n\n            LOOKING FOR               \n\n\n           - .pl ,.ro ,.hu ,.no ,.cz sites, ask around if you cant find us :D\n           - 10mbit + dump for private usage\n           - TV-DVD / DVDR / x264 suplliers\n           - Experienced xvid / bluray rippers  \n\n\n            GREETZ      \n\n\n             731 , CHRONO, SYS, AVCHD, AVCDVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a1b01a5d30bb08a401517e44aaa0b1a736946fb","amp;dn":"Summer.Coda.2010.DVDRip.XviD-PFa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a1b01a5d30bb08a401517e44aaa0b1a736946fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,27,1,165,211,11,176,138,64,21,23,228,74,170,11,26,115,105,70,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
