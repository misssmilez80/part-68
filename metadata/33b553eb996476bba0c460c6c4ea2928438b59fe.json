The result is a    \n  no-holds-barred view of the dynamics and universal themes of family   \n  life.                                                                 \n                                                                        \n  Dad Angelo, Mum Josephine, and their three boys - David (20), Stefan  \n  (18), and Adrian (14) - live in the outer suburbs of Melbourne.       \n  There is nothing unusual about them, except that they agreed to take  \n  part in this project. When we meet them, we find out Dad works in     \n  the construction industry, Mum in cosmetic sales, David is at uni,    \n  Stefan is in his last year of school, and Adrian is in Year 9. They   \n  have lots of friends and extended family who pop in.                  \n                                                                        \n  Over eight weeks, we watch their lives unfold; from exam results to   \n  birthday parties, from pizza nights to Christmas celebrations - the   \n  stuff of everyday life. But by allowing such intimate filming of      \n  their lives the Cardamones also reveal all that is behind the         \n  ordinary. The emotions, the tensions, the strengths and the           \n  weaknesses that shape the way we all behave. Its not always pretty,  \n  but its real.                                                        \n                                                                        \n  The Family is about the Cardamones, but it is also about all of us.   \n  What makes us tick, how do we interact, and how do we celebrate,      \n  commiserate, and consider our lives?                                  \n                                                                        \n  Episode 1: Married With Children                                      \n                                                                        \n  After 25 years of marriage, Angelo and Josephine have learnt to       \n  negotiate most things.
