Leonard, starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. The screenplay was rewritten from the book for Sigmund Romberg's 1917 operetta Maytime by Rida Johnson Young, Romberg's librettist; however, only one musical number by Romberg was retained. The film's storyline greatly resembles that of Noel Coward's operetta Bitter Sweet, right down to the &quot;frame story&quot; surrounding the main plot. Three years later, MGM filmed a Technicolor version of Bitter Sweet, but altered the plot slightly so that audiences would not notice the similarities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68256d6e98cf5023adec0247062f5b6439ce337","amp;dn":"Maytime+%281937%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68256d6e98cf5023adec0247062f5b6439ce337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,130,86,214,233,140,245,2,58,222,192,36,112,98,245,182,67,156,227,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
