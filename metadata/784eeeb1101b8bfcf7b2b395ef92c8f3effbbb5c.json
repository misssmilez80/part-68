Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the best there is at extraction: stealing valuable secrets inside the subconscious during the mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vulnerable dream state. His skill has made him a coveted player in industrial espionage but also has made him a fugitive and cost him dearly. Now he may get a second chance if he can do the impossible: inception, planting an idea rather than stealing one. If they succeed, Cobb and his team could pull off the perfect crime. But no planning or expertise can prepare them for a dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy only Cobb could have seen coming.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:784eeeb1101b8bfcf7b2b395ef92c8f3effbbb5c","amp;dn":"Inception+%282010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"784eeeb1101b8bfcf7b2b395ef92c8f3effbbb5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,78,238,177,16,27,139,252,247,178,179,149,239,146,200,243,239,251,187,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
