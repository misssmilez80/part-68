With an improvised set-up comprising drums, wind instruments and electronics they play brachial free Jazz/ Noise improvs at everyday venues badly in need of some culture ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ such as pedestrian zones in Munich, in front of a miners audience in the Ruhr District, or in the countryside under the stars. This film is a rare and haunting document of some of Krautrock's outstanding pioneers.\n\nThis is not an .avi - it is a folder containing the VTS files etc. Subtitles are an optional track that can be clicked on and off with remote control.\n\nThis is also the first time I have uploaded anything so i apologize for any glitches.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da5f372fb8131526eea1e1708fdb54172f3d6be1","amp;dn":"Anima+Sound+1971","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da5f372fb8131526eea1e1708fdb54172f3d6be1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,95,55,47,184,19,21,38,238,161,225,112,143,219,84,23,47,61,107,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
