Schneider offers Laura a job entertaining the      \n    dealer's customers, but while the money is good, she soon learns that    \n    her new employers are significantly more sinister than she imagined.     \n    Starring Elizabeth Bing and Bob Strong, Run Swinger Run has also been    \n    screened under the title Nude On The Run.                                \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
