Jim Shannon, a devoted father with a checkered past, guides his family through this new world of limitless beauty, mystery and terror. Upon the Shannons\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' arrival, they are introduced to Cmdr. Nathaniel Taylor, the charismatic and heroic first pioneer and leader of the settlement. Taylor warns the travelers that while Terra Nova is a place of new opportunities and fresh beginnings, all is not as idyllic as it initially appears. Along with blue skies, towering waterfalls and lush vegetation, the surrounding terrain is teeming with danger - and not just of the man-eating dinosaur variety. There is also a splinter colony of renegades led by the battle-hardened Mira, who is vehemently opposed to Taylor and his leadership.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc0aec88a9505ed3ba5c1cf922d346a3553528f","amp;dn":"Terra.Nova.S01E01.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-ECI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc0aec88a9505ed3ba5c1cf922d346a3553528f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,192,174,200,138,149,5,237,59,165,193,207,146,45,52,106,53,83,82,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
