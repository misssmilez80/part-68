This version includes 8 new novels and one replacement; it is current up to the summer of 2011. I have processed all these unabridged books in the following ways:\n\n1. I ripped 20 of these. Whenever possible I ripped from CD. A few are ripped from high-quality cassettes. The ones I did not rip are not always of such excellent quality but are all decent and very listenable.\n\n2. Equalized volume. Several of these audio books had volume discontinuities. I have equalized volumes so there shouldn't be any sudden jumps.\n\n3. Dehissed and noise-cleaned. When needed, I performed low pass filters and deleted pops in the audio.\n\n4. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This took weeks and weeks. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like &quot;end of disc 3, please insert disc 4&quot;) and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods.\n\n5. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.\n\n6. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART. Thanks to a few excellent websites, I have been able to offer FIRST EDITION covers for all books.\n\nAnd so here comes to you a 25gb torrent with all 43 Clive Cussler novels; it now represents a complete collection of Clive Cussler's fictional works. Since the original torrent there have been a couple of changes. First, and most obviously, I have added Clive's most recent 8 novels -- all chapterized and tagged like the rest. Also, one of the earlier novels, 1988 - Treasure (Dirk Pitt 9), was incomplete in my original torrent. I am delighted to say I have found a replacement copy and present it here! This collection is now 100% complete.\n\nPlease leave any comments, questions, or suggestions you might have as they are HIGHLY APPRECIATED! :)\n\nEnjoy!\n--CL8\n\n\n-------------Included in this torrent-------------\n1973 - Dirk Pitt 01 - The Mediterranean Caper (read by Michael Prichard)\n1975 - Dirk Pitt 02 - Iceberg (read by Michael Prichard)\n1976 - Dirk Pitt 03 - Raise the Titanic!
