Using previously unseen and unknown private footage, we peel away from the facade of the formal camera to explore a defining, yet controversial chapter in Elvis' life, which not only stifled him, but also defined him as the superstar that he would forever be known.\n\nThis documentary gives Elvis fans unprecedented access into the years when the singer worked and lived in Las Vegas. Packed with intimate home movie footage, the documentary aims to shed some light on a period in Elvis's career more often mocked than seriously examined.\n\nMore Elvis:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/jeroep/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/jeroep/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c23082e76a2ae3991356113f847344489529532","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Destination+Vegas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c23082e76a2ae3991356113f847344489529532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,35,8,46,118,162,174,57,145,53,97,19,248,71,52,68,137,82,149,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
