One day, she stumbles across the decidedly peculiar but very popular Ouran Host Club. She tries to leave, but accidentally breaks a vase, and unable to pay for it, she's told that she'll have to stay and do odd jobs. That is, until they decide she would be more valuable as a club member. Not realizing she's female due to her appearance, they fix her up and give her a male uniform. She's an instant hit, so they decide to have her keep up the charade even after they find out the truth. Haruhi, being average almost to a fault, doesn't know what to make of the unconventional activities of the Host Club (or of the even more unconventional members), but having little choice, she plays along. Before long, real bonds are formed, friends made, and Haruhi finds herself accepted in a way she could never have been otherwise in this affluent school.\n\nEpisode Details:\n=============\n\n06 \t&quot;The Grade School Host is the Naughty Type!&quot;\n\nAn elementary school brat, Shiro Takaoji, seeks help from the host club to win the heart of women. Renge helps develop a role for him, being a naughty type. However, Shiro denounces the whole club as idiots and runs away. The host club infiltrate the elementary school, disguising Haruhi as a middle-school student and Mitsukuni &quot;Honey&quot; Haninozuka as an elementary-school student. The club then discovers that Shiro has a crush on a girl who would soon be moving away. Tamaki explains to that Shiro only wants to win the heart of the girl he has a crush on, Hina Kamishiro, by joining the classical music club and playing the piano with her to make her happy. Shiro learns his part of the piano duet he was supposed to have played with her, and the host club ends up allowing Shiro and Hina to have a small concert in the host club lounge. \n\n07 \t&quot;Jungle Pool SOS!&quot;\n\nThe host club drags Haruhi to an artificial tropical water park, but an accident involving the wave pool separates Honey from the rest of the gang. Haruhi and Takashi &quot;Mori&quot; Morinozuka separate from the rest of the group to look for him, and Mori carries Haruhi due to the fact that she is scared of the jungle animals. Haruhi wonders aloud about Honey and Mori's relationship, and then twins explain that they are in fact cousins by marriage. Meanwhile, Kyoya hires guards to look for Honey as well as to arrest any suspicious people. However, they end up mistaking Haruhi as what Kyoya had described Honey as, as well as mistaking Mori as a suspicious person. Honey swings in on a vine, amazing Haruhi with his martial arts ability, as he quickly subdues the guards. The guards apologize to Honey for attacking him, realizing that Honey is actually a world-renowned martial-artist. The host club reunites, as Haruhi mentions that she would rather enjoy visiting an actual beach. \n\n08 \t&quot;The Sun, the Sea, and the Host Club!&quot;\n\nThe host club, along with some of the customers, visits a beach in Okinawa upon Haruhi's request. Hikaru and Kaoru devise a game to find out Haruhi's phobia. Kyoya hypes up the competition by offering up photos of Haruhi in middle school, refusing to explain where he got them. However, Haruhi is thrown into the sea, after defending some girls who were being intimidated by a pair of drunken punks. Tamaki rebukes Haruhi for being so reckless, causing them to avoid each other for the day. Kyoya appears to try to sexually assault Haruhi, only to reveal her vulnerability, convincing her to apologize to Tamaki. Tamaki wins the competition discreetly in the end, finding out she has brontophobia, the fear of thunder and lightning, when he sees Haruhi hiding in a closet. However, the rest of the host club walks in at the most inappropriate moment, as he covers her ears and eyes to help deal with the phobia. Unfortunately, the rest of the host club misperceives Tamaki involving Haruhi in sexual activity, or as they said S&amp;M. \n\n09 \t&quot;A Challenge from Lobelia Girls' Academy!&quot;\n\nBenio &quot;Benibara&quot; Amakusa, head of the Zuka club at Lobelia Girls' Academy, chances upon Haruhi and, instantly recognizing that she is a girl, tries to convince her to join her school and her club. Convinced that Haruhi will leave them, the boys dress up as girls to show Haruhi that she could be around boys and girls at the same time. Haruhi reveals that she came to Ouran Academy for a reason, and says that she was never planning to leave for Lobelia Girls' Academy in the first place. The Zuka club girls leave, but refuse to give up, warning the club that they will be back for Haruhi. \n\n10 \t&quot;A Day in the Life of the Fujioka Family!&quot;\n\nInterested in the unknown ways of a &quot;commoner's lifestyle&quot;, the host club makes an unannounced appearance at Haruhi's house to meet her family and see how she lives. Unintentionally, all the club members make themselves rather unwelcome, constantly commenting on how small the house is, and asking for things. Then, just as Haruhi is leaving to get food for lunch, her father, Ryoji &quot;Ranka&quot; Fujioka, arrives, revealing that he is a transvestite. Haruhi then leaves, and Ranka asks the host club to come with him as he follows Haruhi, partly to watch Haruhi being so independent, and partly so that he can be seen with a group of handsome boys. Tamaki then realizes how independent Haruhi is, as well as some reasons why.\n\nFormat: .mp4\n======\n\nEnglish Subtitle by: Speedy Joe\n===============\n\nUploader Notes:\n==============\n\nIts one of the best animes in the comedy genre....please check it out...\nSeed...enjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f9e9b49bc1c763e019fa44ce7c13c5da1143b48","amp;dn":"Ouran+High+School+Host+Club+Ep.6-10+%28Eng.+Sub%29+%5Bimsourav%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f9e9b49bc1c763e019fa44ce7c13c5da1143b48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,158,155,73,188,28,118,62,1,159,164,76,231,193,60,93,161,20,59,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
