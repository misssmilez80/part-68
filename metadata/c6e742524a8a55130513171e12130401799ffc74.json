The crow guides him through the land of the living, and leads him to his killers: knife thrower Tin-tin, drugetic Funboy, car buff T-Bird, and the unsophisticated Skank. One by one, Eric gives these thugs a taste of their own medicine. However their leader Top-Dollar, a world-class crime lord who will dispatch his enemies with a Japanese sword and joke about it later, will soon learn the legend of the crow and the secret to the vigilante's invincibility.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109506/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109506/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6e742524a8a55130513171e12130401799ffc74","amp;dn":"The+Crow+%281994%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6e742524a8a55130513171e12130401799ffc74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,231,66,82,74,138,85,19,5,19,23,30,18,19,4,1,121,159,252,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
