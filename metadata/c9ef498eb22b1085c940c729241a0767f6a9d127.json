It's also, after some searching, that there's no real Canadian compilation out there on torrent network. Lots of UK ones to be found, American ones, Rolling Stone, etc but nothing Canadian. So I took it upon myself to throw this together and after 3 months it's finally been completed. First off I would like to thank all the uploaders that helped make this possible for the albums I don't have. There's too many to name so a big THANK YOU to all. \n\nI realize this is a huge 28.2 GB file and was thinking about splitting it in half or in thirds but I have a few other 20+ GB torrents and after 3 years they are trading well although probably not the most efficiently. So just be patient for the download - I know it's going to take some time.\n\nMost of all Enjoy!\n\nKit\n\n\n\n-Audiochecker logs included for rips that are not mine.\n\n-Some albums include artwork.\n\n- K-os - Joyful Rebellion ripped using burst mode due to a scuffed disc. I do not hear any audible skips or distortions so will leave it in the torrent but it's not exactly the rip I wanted.\n\n- Steppenwolf 1968 is a MFSL rip.\n\n- The Guess Who - Wheatfield Soul was ripped from a 2 album-combination CD that included Artificial Paradise. The EAC log will reflect this as I have only included Wheatfield Soul.\n\n- The Band - Music From Big Pink includes bonus tracks that the EAC log reflects and are not included.\n\n- A few were double Cd's that included 2 albums from a band so obviously just included the one that made the list. The EAC log file might reflect this.\n\n- Remasters include (that are labeled as a Remaster):\n\nNeil Young - Harvest\nThe Band - Music From The Big Pink\nThe Band - The Band\nRush - Moving Pictures\nLeonard Cohen - Songs of Leonard Cohen\nNeil Young - Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\nLeonard Cohen - Songs Of love And Hate\nNeil Young - On The Beach\nThe Guess Who - Best Of\nThe Band - The Last Waltz\nOscar Peterson Trio - Night Train\nWillie P. Bennett - Hobo's Taunt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Top 100 Canadian Albums 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\n\nThe Top 100 Canadian Albums is a book by Bob Mersereau, published in 2007 by Goose Lane Editions.\n\nMersereau acknowledged that the list will cause heated debate among music fans across the country. &quot;The important part is to talk about Canadian music and enjoy it&quot;, he said. &quot;I'd be shocked if there wasn't complaints and arguments and debates.&quot;\n\nMersereau surveyed 600 music journalists, retailers, musicians and disc jockeys of all ages, from all parts of Canada. They each submitted a list of 10 favourite Canadian albums released between 1957 and 2007.\n\n\n\nCriticism\n\nA review from the National Post by Mark Medley identifies regional and genre biases in the book. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhile any list of &quot;Top 100&quot; anything is sure to ignite some controversy, there are definitely some glaring omissions from journalist Bob Mersereau's new book.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He lists 10 albums he considers to be amongst these glaring omissions. Four of these albums are from British Columbia artists. One of these was The New PornographersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Mass Romantic. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTo completely leave off Carl Newman, Neko Case et al. is plain wrong. I'm grouping in Stars' 2004 album Set Yourself on Fire in with this.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Medley also noted the omission of BC band The Grapes of Wrath's album Now and Again. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis album cracked the top 50 in Chart Magazine's 1996 and 2000 top 50 Canadian albums polls.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He also notes the under representation of hip hop artists, and lists Maestro Fresh WesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Symphony in Effect and Dream Warriors' And Now the Legacy Begins as two of his omissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Top 100 Canadian Albums 2007\n\n\n\n* Denotes My Rip, includes Catalog #\n\n\n1.Harvest, Neil Young (1972) 2-517937 *\n2.Blue, Joni Mitchell (1971) CD 2038 *\n3.After the Gold Rush, Neil Young (1970) CD 2283 *\n4.Music From Big Pink, The Band (1968) 72435-25390-2-4 *\n5.Fully Completely, The Tragically Hip (1992) CMCASD 10700 *\n6.Jagged Little Pill, Alanis Morissette (1995)  CDW 45901 *\n7.The Band, The Band (1969) 72435-25389-2-8 * \n8.Funeral, Arcade Fire (2004) MRG 255 *\n9.Moving Pictures, Rush (1981) ANMD1082 *\n10.American Woman, The Guess Who (1970)\n11.Songs of Leonard Cohen, Leonard Cohen (1967) 88697 04742 2 *\n12.Reckless, Bryan Adams (1984) CD 5013 DIDX 140 *\n13.Five Days in July, Blue Rodeo (1993) W2 93846 *\n14.Twice Removed, Sloan (1994) DGCSD 24711 *\n15.Up to Here, The Tragically Hip (1989) MCAMD-6310 *\n16.Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, Neil Young with Crazy Horse (1969) 2-517935 *\n17.2112, Rush (1976) ANMD1078 *\n18.Court and Spark, Joni Mitchell (1974) ASYLUM CD 1001 *\n19.Whale Music, Rheostatics (1992) 9 45564-2 *\n20.Acadie, Daniel Lanois (1989) FNCD5543 *\n21.Day for Night, The Tragically Hip (1994) MCASD 11140 *\n22.Rust Never Sleeps, Neil Young &amp;
