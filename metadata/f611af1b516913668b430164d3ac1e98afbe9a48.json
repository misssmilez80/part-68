BetterZip can open and extract archives \n  with the most common formats: ZIP, SIT, TAR, XAR, GZip, BZip2,\n  RAR, 7-Zip, CPIO, ARJ, LZH/LHA, JAR, WAR, CAB, ISO, CHM,\n  RPM, DEB, NSIS, BIN, HQX.\n\n* Create Archives: Simply drag files and folders from your hard drives, \n  disks, or network places into your new zip file. You no longer have to\n  copy all the files into a temporary folder first. The supported formats are\n  ZIP, TAR, GZip and BZip2 compressed TAR, XAR, 7-ZIP, and RAR\n  (using the external RAR commandline tool). Large archives can also be\n  split.\n\n* Protect Your Data: BetterZip can protect your data with a password and\n  create WinZip compatible AES-256 encrypted archives. 7-zip and rar\n  archives can also be protected.\n\n* Update Archives: Add new or updated files to existing archives.\n  Remove any file or folder from an archive, or even move files around\n  inside the archive as if it were a normal folder.\n\n* Make Archives Compatible: Strip Mac specific files and resource forks\n  from archives for best compatibility with systems like Windows or\n  Linux.\n\nWhat's New\n\nNew Features\n\n* Using the service 'Extract with BetterZip' you can now extract all\n  archives in a folder hierarchy.\n\n* If files are selected in the archive window, presets now only extract \n  those instead of all files. Hold down Shift to extract all anyway.\n\n* Enhanced 'replace existing files' dialog: it now allows to merge extracted\n  items into existing folders, keep both versions or replace the existing\n  version with the one from the archive.\n\nEnhancements\n\n* Enhanced accessibility.\n\n* Improved SIT file handling.\n\n* The favorites sidebar is now populated in the background and there is\n  no longer a delay when starting BetterZip.\n\n* Re-added 'Terminate after last window closed' option.\n\n* Enabled the additional parameters field for tar archives.\n\n* Holding down the option key now shows a save panel even for services\n  or direct extraction.\n\n* The location preset in the save panel is now by default next to original\n /archive.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n* Fixed two bugs that could lead to a crash.\n\n* BetterZip now uses the original encryption method when resaving an \n  archive, i.e., header encryption will be retained.\n\n* Splitting 7z archives was off by a factor 1024.\n\n* The Save toolbar button wasn't correctly initialized with the default\n  preset.\n\n* Cancelling archive creation through a service in the save panel no longer\n  displays a confusing message.\n\n* Moving or deleting the external rar program could lead to a crash when \n  saving with a preset with rar format.\n\n* The progress bar no longer gets stuck when hiding BetterZip while\n  extracting large archive.\n\n* Extracting an archive via context menu while the same archive was open\n  in BZ could crash BetterZip.\n\n* Fixed a problem with extracting read-only folders in archives.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac OS version: Mac OS X 10.6 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f611af1b516913668b430164d3ac1e98afbe9a48","amp;dn":"BetterZip+v+2.1+pre%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f611af1b516913668b430164d3ac1e98afbe9a48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,17,175,27,81,105,19,102,139,67,1,100,211,172,30,152,175,190,154,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
