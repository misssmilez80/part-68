People have been emailing me asking to make my tutorials downloadable as there internet is slow or they want to learn offline. Finally I have managed to get it done and I have added some of the courses below. Please do check back as I will be adding more tutorials soon. \n\nPlease be aware that the file size is big. Inside each folder is the lesson files and videos, you will need winrar to be able to open the folders,you can download it for free here. All video files are MP4 so they can play on mac and PC.\n\nIf you would like to have the tutorial courses sent to you on cd then I can do that as well, all I ask is that you pay the cost of the cd and the shipping. \nFor the time being the cd will be just a basic DVD with no fancy graphics on the cover. \nAlso remember that the tutorials on the DVD are exactly the same as the tutorials on my website.
