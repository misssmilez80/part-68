Kaufman and Moss Hart. The cast includes James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold.\n\nThe movie won two Academy Awards from seven nominations: Best Picture and Best Director for Frank Capra. This was Capra's third Oscar for Best Director in just five years, following It Happened One Night in 1934 and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town in 1936. It was also the highest-grossing picture of the year.\n\nPlot\n\nAlice (Jean Arthur), the only relatively normal member of the eccentric Sycamore family, falls in love with Tony Kirby (James Stewart). His wealthy banker father, Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold), and his snobbish mother (Mary Forbes), strongly disapprove of the match. When the Kirbys are invited to dinner to become better acquainted with their future in-laws, things do not turn out the way Alice had hoped.\n\nCast\n\nJean Arthur as Alice Sycamore\nLionel Barrymore as Grandpa Martin Vanderhof\nJames Stewart as Tony Kirby\nEdward Arnold as Anthony P.
