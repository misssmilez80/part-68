Known for its consistency and quality, \n Subculture represents a sound that is both distinctive as well as \n groundbreaking. The mastermind behind all this, is John OÃƒâ€žÃ‚ÂºCallaghan. \n He marks the Subculture story of success with a yearly chapter of his \n critically acclaimed Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹SubcultureÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº compilation, now heading for its \n third edition, Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Subculture 2011Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Âº. \n\n In April, John released his third and most creative artist album, \n Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹UnfoldÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº, including hit singles Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Save This MomentÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº, Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Talk To MeÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº, \n Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹CenturionÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº and Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Ride The WaveÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº. John isnÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºt only the winner of three \n Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Best DJÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº and two Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Best ProducerÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº trophies by the Irish Dance Music \n Awards, but also gets his weekly round of applause during his \n worldwide gigs. If someoneÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºs got an keen ear for anything that gets a \n crowd moving, itÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºs John. \n\n Mixed and selected by the number one Irish DJ and producer, \n Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Subculture 2011Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Âº is there for the dedicated following of the label, \n as well as those into its significant sound of energy, power and \n feel. Including 4 sparkling new, exclusive originals and remixes by \n John, as well as tracks by the likes of Neal Scarborough, Aly &amp; Fila, \n Will Atkinson, Giuseppe Ottaviani, Sebastian Brandt and many more. \n John: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶IÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºm so thankful to artists like Heatbeat, Tom Colontonio, \n Chris Metcalfe, Full Tilt, Sneijder to name but a few Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¾ for providing \n me with very hard choices to pick for these releases! Along with the \n events which we have planned for London, Dublin, Belfast, Newcastle &amp; \n LA Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¯ 2012 looks promising for Subculture!ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40f6d5fc6c63f5f8edbf42cc2e2a09f20b28da38","amp;dn":"VA-Subculture_2011_%28Mixed_By_John_O_Callaghan%29-2CD-2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40f6d5fc6c63f5f8edbf42cc2e2a09f20b28da38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,246,213,252,108,99,245,248,237,191,66,204,46,42,9,242,11,40,218,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
