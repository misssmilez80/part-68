Each chapter, including grain crops and fruits, spices and seaweed, legumes and mushrooms among its 19 topics, is a cornucopia of information and beautiful, educational illustrations. Take the chapter on oil crops, for example. Covering olives, sesame, peanuts, soy beans, sunflowers, and the rape plant, the prose describes where they grow and what the fruits look like, what kind of oil is produced and what it's used for, how it's made and how else the fruits may be used. Color drawings of the plants and their fruits are on the facing page. Put together by writers who respect each plant and give them the attention and detail that spell quality, this is a beautiful book and a charming resource. --Stephanie Gold --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nFrom Library Journal\nThis revision of the popular but now somewhat dated Oxford Book of Food Plants (LJ 4/1/70) describes and pictures fruit, vegetables, herbs, spices, grains, and nuts from around the world, most familiar but some unfamiliar. Vaughan (emeritus, food sciences) and Geissler (nutrition), both at King's College, London, revised all the original entries but kept the same format and plant groupings; B.E. Nicholson's beautiful full-page color illustrations were also retained, and a few new ones were added. A one-page description of the plant group and its plants, often mentioning specific cultivars, is followed by illustrations of those plants on the facing page. A new chapter on nutrition and health and some food composition tables are included. This guide will appeal to a broad audience and is recommended for all public and academic libraries.?William H.
