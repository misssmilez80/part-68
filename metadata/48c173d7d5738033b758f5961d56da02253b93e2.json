For instance Allan Moore, the creator of Watchmen, had a &quot;magical conversion&quot; after his encounter with a multi-dimensional demon in 1994, and comic book writer Grant Morrison (known for X-Men) had a mystical encounter in Nepal with &quot;5th-dimensional mercury-like silver beings that showed him all sorts of things,&quot; Kripal detailed. We're in the midst of a &quot;boiling cultural soup&quot; with increasing paranormal themes which add up to a super-story or grand mythology that human beings are &quot;essentially mini-gods in disguise,&quot; who are developing greater abilities and capacities, he explained.\n\nOne reason we're seeing these paranormal themes play out so strongly in film and pop-culture is because they aren't considered seriously in universities, and the science world, he said. Science doesn't have a handle on the mind and consciousness, and &quot;that's ultimately what the paranormal is about,&quot; he continued.\n\nHe looked at the creation of various superheroes, such as Superman (one of the first, his name was likely derived from Nietzsche's term ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œbermensch), and Spider-Man, whom he noted bears a similarity to certain descriptions of aliens. In fact, Barney Hill described Spider-Man type eyes for the alien that abducted him, said Kripal, adding that &quot;we're in a situation where something real has happened and we're getting bleed-through from the popular culture.&quot; One of the first descriptions of what we consider aliens was in Etidorpha, a novel published in 1895, that contained bizarre illustrations of a being with an immense forehead and no eyes. It's speculated that the book's author John Lloyd was experimenting with hallucinogenic or visionary plant substances which triggered his imagination.\n\nWebsite(s):\n\n   kripal.rice.edu\n\nBook(s):\n\n   Mutants and Mystics\n   Authors of the Impossible: The Paranormal and the Sacred","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c173d7d5738033b758f5961d56da02253b93e2","amp;dn":"Coast+To+Coast+AM+-+23.10.2011+-+Sci-Fi%2C+Superheroes%2C+%26amp%3B+the+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48c173d7d5738033b758f5961d56da02253b93e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,193,115,215,213,115,128,51,183,88,245,150,29,86,218,2,37,59,147,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
