It's full of startling revelations, exploding the myth of the Long March, and showing a complete unknown Mao: he was not driven by idealism of ideology; his intimate and intricate relations with Stalin went back to the 1920s, ultimately bringing him to power; he welcomed Japanese occupation of much of China; and schemed, poisoned, and blackmailed to get his way. After Mao conquered China in 1949, his secret goal was to dominate the world. In chasing his dream he caused the death of 38 million people in the greatest famine in history.In all, over 70 million Chinese perished under Mao's rule - in peacetime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33413e1bc3eb04d32ea8cea224eb7e7a4fb45000","amp;dn":"Mao%2C+The+Unknown+Story.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33413e1bc3eb04d32ea8cea224eb7e7a4fb45000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,65,62,27,195,235,4,211,46,168,206,162,36,235,126,122,79,180,80,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
