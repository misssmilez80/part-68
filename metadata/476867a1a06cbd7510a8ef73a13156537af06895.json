Written by Francis Turnly; Full-cast dramatisation.\n\nWhen Garda officer Detective Sergeant Roisin MacKenna is called to the scene of a murder not far from the border between the North and South of Ireland she soon finds that boundaries, both geographical and moral, become blurred.\n\nA body has been found buried in an Irish peat bog.
