Anything less than that and you'll be toast before completing your first level!\nThe intense indie 'bullet hell' genre is invading your PC with 3 action-packed games, including Gundemonium Recollection, GundeadliGne, and Hitogata Happa. Each provide non-stop fast-paced attacks, unpredictable kamikaze foes and meticulously crafted 2D anime art with their own unique gameplay styles, that will make you want to lock and load over and over again.\n\n\nGundemonium Recollection\nThe first game in the Gundemonium trilogy, and tells a story of alchemy gone wrong in an alternate 18th century. Its galvanized and finely tuned side-scrolling bullet-hell shoot-'em-up gameplay sets it well above most other games in the genre. The game is deceptively simple from the outset, but has very well-thought-out gameplay mechanics. There are multiple playable characters, expertly crafted enemies and bullet patterns, a variable-difficulty &quot;Phase Level&quot; system, a risk-and-reward bullet &quot;Friction&quot; system, a &quot;Demonic Shift&quot; ability that's not for the faint of heart, and much more.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 5 levels of intense bullet-flying action\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sweet Old school retro anime-style art\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Two playable characters to choose from and a third you can unlock\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Story, Practice and Mission modes to take your shooting skills to the max\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 32 Steam achievements\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Full online leaderboards\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New arranged soundtrack by DM Ashura\n\nGundeadliGne\nThe second game in the Gundemonium trilogy, and continues the tale of humanity's war with hell brought on by alchemy. Its gameplay is a second extra-strength dosage of the kind of bullet-hell shoot-'em-up pandemonium found in Gundemonium Recollection, but with a dramatically game-altering &quot;Flip Turn&quot; ability. If you're tired of getting flanked in other shoot-'em-ups, now you can turn the tables and get your revenge. GundeadliGne also supports two-player cooperative play, so a friend can join the action and cover your six.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 5 levels of bullet hell craziness\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sweet old-school retro anime-style art\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Two playable characters and an unlockable third\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 6 Matrix Masters to choose from\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 2 unlockable mission modes\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 11 Steam achievements\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Local two-player multiplayer mode\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Steamworks two-player online multiplayer mode\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Full online leaderboards\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New arranged soundtrack by DM Ashura\n\nHitogata Happa\nThe third game in the Gundemonium trilogy, but the events in its storyline take place before the previous games. It has chaotic bullet-hell shoot-'em-up gameplay similar to that of the first two games, but it's also wildly different. The action is now scrolling vertically, and you'll be taking control of an array of deadly self-destructive flying dolls. Each one has its own game-changing abilities. You'll have to decide which to use, when they'll fight on, and when it's time for them to make the ultimate crash-and-burn sacrifice.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 6 stages of vertical-scrolling bullet insanity\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sweet old-school retro anime-style art\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 8 playable characters, and 4 unlockable characters\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 2 unlockable special modes\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 13 Steam achievements\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Full online leaderboards\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New arranged soundtrack by Woofle\n\nSystem requirements:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Windows XP/Vista/7\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DirectX 9\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 1 GHz\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 256 MB RAM\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25b9e95e0aaee8399ae41ecca8da55cf4bfd8a95","amp;dn":"Gundemonium+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25b9e95e0aaee8399ae41ecca8da55cf4bfd8a95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,185,233,94,10,174,232,57,154,228,30,204,168,218,85,207,75,253,138,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
