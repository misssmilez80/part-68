The bombast at the close might not be to everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s liking, but it seems to gel nicely. Meanwhile the sweet roots pop of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmong The SurvivorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ shines with its tight rhythm section and barroom keyboards.\n\n With guest appearances by WilcoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Nels Cline, Minnie Driver and Tom Petty and The HeartbreakersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Benmont Tench and Dave Rawlings among others, The Latebirds have a very credible batch of songs from start to finish. Although a few songs such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTime To LiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sound just a bit too polished, resulting in a loss of that spark, the group soars on the Dylan-ish ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSummer Becomes FallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ if backed by Tench and company. And the gentle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLike Father Like SonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ oozes folksy campfire fodder.\n\n If thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one true standout aside from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou Cynical YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ it has to be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFearless,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a haunting rocker revolving around Russian journalist Ana Politkovskaja who was murdered in 2006. The song hits its groove early and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t come off too preachy or soapbox-ish. Another keeper is the barnstorming ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKickinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ recalling an early, confident Tom Petty. \n\n brief reprise of the opener is bizarrely found near the homestretch but a five-song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWoodstock SessionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ bonus EP (with Kris Kristofferson, Levon Helm and David Rawlings appearing here) more than atones for the miscue with delicate covers of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe City Of New OrleansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Townes Van ZandtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTo Live Is To Fly.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/09/02/the-latebirds/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb9119c7fb66668c6b460faa995f7a13742ca863","amp;dn":"The+Latebirds...Last+of+the+Good+Ol%5C%27+Days%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb9119c7fb66668c6b460faa995f7a13742ca863","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,145,25,199,251,102,102,140,107,70,15,170,153,95,122,19,116,44,168,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
