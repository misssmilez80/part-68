During one night, Balwant, along with his pregnant wife, get into a car accident. While the accident causes Balwant to die right away, his wife is rescued by Sartaj, and she later gives birth to a child named Lovely. Lovely Singh (Salman Khan), now grown up, is the bodyguard of Sartaj's daughter Divya (Kareena Kapoor). He is very devoted to his duties but irritates her all the time by following her everywhere. Consequently, Divya and her friend Maya (Hazel Keech) call Lovely and start a prank love affair, hoping to keep him away from them. Lovely starts loving the mystery person but doesn't realise that it is Divya who was behind all of this. Divya tells Lovely that her name is &quot;Chhaya&quot;. Meanwhile, Sartaj begins to suspect that Lovely and Divya are together and sends his men to kill Lovely in case his lover turns out to be Divya. Sensing this, Divya sends her friend Maya to tell Lovely her true identity. In a twist, it is revealed that Maya is also in love with Lovely. She falsely accepts that she is his lover. They marry and have a child. Maya dies early and reveals to her son in her diary about her fraud and asks him to unite Lovely and Divya.\n\n::Trackers::\nCode: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nyaatorrents.info:3277/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nyaatorrents.info:3277/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInfo Hash:F51BA5DE5428B9F161E0697EB0AB7332AB8F9390\n\n::Screen Shots::\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/89407600064939130393.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/94392461283918074511.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/06529388290315992441.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/74283660407846357798.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/77416841910056229179.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/71403584522819621888.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/51322144410616101776.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/67712277866638704803.png[/img]\n\nNote:A Bonuse Video Track added as Sample\n\nwe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\nSearch Silver Release Group at FB\n\n\n::Greetz::\nTo All Silver RG Encoders,AliBaloch,Emad,TrT/TcT,Torrentstate,DarkNight,MXMG,BigW,HDScene RG &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n::Note::\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silvertorrents.me,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f51ba5de5428b9f161e0697eb0ab7332ab8f9390","amp;dn":"Bodyguard+2011+DvDRip+x264+Ali+Baloch+Silver+RG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f51ba5de5428b9f161e0697eb0ab7332ab8f9390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,27,165,222,84,40,185,241,97,224,105,126,176,171,115,50,171,143,147,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
