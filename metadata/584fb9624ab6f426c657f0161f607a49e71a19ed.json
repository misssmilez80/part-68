Upon hearing that famous Count Cagliostro is touring Russia and has created quite a buzz in high society with his &quot;magic&quot;, he decides to ask the Count to bring the statue to life... &quot;\n\n&quot;This one of the films which can be used as a test for ones intelligence. It calls for an ability to understand subtle multilayered humor, hints, double-meanings and symbolisms. It`s rating speaks for itself. Where else can you see such a mixture of humor and philosophy. First the phrase brings the laughter, but leaves you thinking further and further.\nEverything is so full of talent, wit and kind wisdom, that it grabs you even if you watch it for hundred times. This is a quality of real art.\nThe script is written by Gorin, who is da Vinci of satirical humor, most of the text has already embedded itself into a former Soviet country modern day folklore.\nSunlion (Riga, Latvia)&quot;\n\n&quot;This movie definitely deserves 10/10. A brilliant piece of pure art. This is an outstanding example of how real movies are being made, especially the low budget ones. &quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h55m35s242.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h55m35s242.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h56m02s3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h56m02s3.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h56m13s107.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h56m13s107.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h56m24s218.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h56m24s218.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h56m39s110.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h56m39s110.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h56m46s185.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/vlcsnap-2011-10-19-15h56m46s185.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------not my rip------\n\nSubs are custom, subtitler unknown.
