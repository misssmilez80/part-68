Additional introductory chapters detail the four main posing styles and reveal how to determine which will work best with a subject, their clothing, the location, and the purpose of the portrait. Chapters for advanced photographers highlight the creation of a wide variety of individual and group posesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including ground, seated, head-and-shoulders, and standingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to be utilized in tandem with stairs, rocks, and other architectural and natural elements. A chapter devoted to the essential business skills needed to professionally schedule appointments, work through consultations, manage sessions, and present and deliver final prints is also included.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 128 pages\n    * Publisher: Amherst Media, Inc.
