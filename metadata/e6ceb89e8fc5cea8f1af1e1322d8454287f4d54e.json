Vampire Journals follows Zachary, a vampire with a conscience, who hunts the vampire bloodline that sired him. After witnessing the love of his life get turned into a vampire, Zachary destroys both her, and his master, and former protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© of Ash, Serena. Zachary, armed with the enchanted sword of a great vampire slayer called Laertes, seeks out the rest of Serena\\'s bloodline to eradicate them. Zachary travels to Bucharest to find Ash. Zachary uses Ash\\'s penchant for music and women to bait him out into the open for attack. Ash sets his sights on pianist Sofia, but is thwarted by Zachary during his first attempt to take Sofia. It is revealed through a conversation between Ash and a seer that Zachary\\'s coming was expected and that the two are destined to fight; however, Ash is to be the victor. Ash does not give up on acquiring Sofia, and hires her for his nightclub. Over the next few nights he drains her of blood, so that he may turn her into a new apprentice. He also makes a deal with Zachary: he will give Zachary a consort, protection from the Sun, and allow Zachary to see Sophia if he leaves the city the following night. While Ash is preparing to sire Sofia, he gives his daytime consult Iris the key to Zachary\\'s room, so that she may dispose of his sleeping body in the sunlight. Seeing that his obsession with Sofia will ruin both their lives, Iris releases Zachary instead. Zachary arrives too late; Sophia has already accepted Ash\\'s blood. Fighting off a weakened Ash, Zachary and Sofia escape from the nightclub. Ash follows them, but the rising sun becomes a problem. Zachary manages to get back the sword and kill Ash, whose body falls into the Sun\\'s rays. Zachary and Sofia then find refuge in a nearby close\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6ceb89e8fc5cea8f1af1e1322d8454287f4d54e","amp;dn":"Vampire+Journals+%281997%29+-+Subspecies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6ceb89e8fc5cea8f1af1e1322d8454287f4d54e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,206,184,158,143,197,206,168,241,175,30,19,34,216,69,66,135,244,213,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
