But, new evidence is being unearthed that may help re-write history. Remains of those who died in battle have been discovered, and for the first time physical evidence is suggesting that Spain\\'s conquest of the Incan Empire may have actually taken twenty years. \n\n\nBrought to life through CGI reconstruction and reenactments, the untold epic saga of decades of guerilla warfare and rebellion are finally revealed as National Geographic uncovers the truth behind the Inca\\'s last stand. \n\n\nBy its height in the early 16th century, the Inca Empire had conquered and absorbed hundreds of other chiefdoms and spanned over 772,000 square miles. Its warriors remained undefeated in battle for nearly a century before falling to the Spanish at the Siege of Lima. How did some 200 European adventurers manage to take down a chiefdom so mighty? Part of the answer lies in resources, specifically the horses, iron, and steel the Spanish had at their disposal. \n\n\nIn this interactive artist\\'s rendering, compare Inca and conquistador soldiers to see how markedly their dress and weaponry differedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½differences that played a decisive role in the fall of the Inca Empire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Jay O.Sanders \n==========================\n\n\n\nProduced by: Graham Townsley\n============================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    The Great Inca Rebellion\nYear.................:    2007\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:51:55\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3  \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    704x400\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1886 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    700 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    26 June 2007  \n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1066050/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1066050/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aabe8b9eb984e2484750c8d5b62dd2c637b59f38","amp;dn":"The+Great+Inca+Rebellion-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aabe8b9eb984e2484750c8d5b62dd2c637b59f38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,190,139,158,185,132,226,72,71,80,200,213,182,45,210,198,55,181,159,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
