They expect the American people to be the insurers of their policies by paying the debt for the nationalization of their programs whether it is student loans, healthcare, or our banking system. Mark discusses the housing market crisis and how the banks are under the pressure of the Obama Administration to get as many loans as they can through their programs. Obama keeps telling us that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwe can't waitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for us to not pass the jobs bill, to which Mark responds yes we can and yes we will! Finally, Mark talks about the Arab Spring in the Middle East and how we have backed a revolution in Libya without truly knowing who we are supporting now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb74c9464d853ef31424a8bcd7fd64d4f1ac7dd6","amp;dn":"The+Mark+Levin+Show+24-Oct-11+CF+mp3+32K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb74c9464d853ef31424a8bcd7fd64d4f1ac7dd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,116,201,70,77,133,62,243,20,36,168,188,215,253,100,212,241,172,125,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
