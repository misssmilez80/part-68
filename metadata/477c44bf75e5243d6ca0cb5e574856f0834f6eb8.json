I've actually been looking for this mini forever after becoming interested in the Secret Empire due to the Spiderman and Moon Knight storylines in the 90s.  This mini features War Machine, TrickShot, Viper and Javelynn.  \nAl thanks to the original scanners, seeders and uploaders\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:477c44bf75e5243d6ca0cb5e574856f0834f6eb8","amp;dn":"Hawkeye+v2+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"477c44bf75e5243d6ca0cb5e574856f0834f6eb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,124,68,191,117,229,36,61,108,160,203,94,87,72,86,240,131,79,110,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
