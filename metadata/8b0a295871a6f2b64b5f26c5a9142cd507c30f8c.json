John Travolta stars as Gabriel Shear, a charismatic spy who plots to steal a multi-billion-dollar fortune in illegal government funds. In order to make his scheme work, however, Gabriel needs some help from a computer hacker, which is where Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) comes in. Stanley has been paroled from prison after serving a lengthy sentence for penetrating the FBI's cyber-surveillance operations. Issued a restraining order that keeps him away from computers and living penniless in a trailer park, Stanley wants only to be reunited with his daughter Holly, who's in the custody of his ex-wife, now remarried to a pornographer. Gabriel and his partner Ginger (Halle Berry) offer Stanley the chance to get his child back in exchange for his help, but the hacker soon realizes he's a pawn in a larger operation than the high-tech bank heist he thought he was perpetrating. In the meantime, a dedicated federal agent (Don Cheadle), the same man who once arrested Stanley, is trying to expose Gabriel's operation. Swordfish also stars Sam Shepard and Zach Grenier.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 39 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 320\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b0a295871a6f2b64b5f26c5a9142cd507c30f8c","amp;dn":"Swordfish%282001%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b0a295871a6f2b64b5f26c5a9142cd507c30f8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,10,41,88,113,166,242,182,75,95,38,197,169,20,44,213,7,195,15,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
