Their output was pop music similar in style to that of the new romantics, but with strong similarities to the post-punk movement of the early 1980s, namely inclusion of a broader range of musical influences and occasional flirtation with political commentary.\n    Albums: What Price Paradise, Working With Fire And Steel, Difficult Shapes And Passive Rhythms, Warped by Success\n\nChina Crisis -Warped by Success (Size: 60.57 MB)\n  \t\t01 Hands on the Wheel.mp3 \t4.78 MB\n  \t\t02 Always.mp3 \t5.84 MB\n  \t\t03 Everyday the same.mp3 \t6.62 MB\n  \t\t04 Without the Love.mp3 \t5.06 MB\n  \t\t05 Thank you.mp3 \t4.15 MB\n  \t\t06 Hard to be Around.mp3 \t4.71 MB\n  \t\t07 One Wish too many.mp3 \t2.42 MB\n  \t\t08 Wishing time.mp3 \t4.03 MB\n  \t\t09 Good Again.mp3 \t4.79 MB\n  \t\t10 Real Tears.mp3 \t5.28 MB\n  \t\t11 Does it Pay.mp3 \t4.66 MB\n  \t\t12 The Way We are made.mp3 \t4.02 MB\n  \t\tDSCN5455.JPG \t1.93 MB\n  \t\tDSCN5456.JPG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:474919d39a26713888fa1c5a24a0880d1afff70c","amp;dn":"China+Crisis+-+Warped+By+Success+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"474919d39a26713888fa1c5a24a0880d1afff70c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,73,25,211,154,38,113,56,136,250,28,90,36,160,136,13,26,255,247,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
