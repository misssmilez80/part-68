With the knowledge acquired using Python, students gain confidence in their skills and acquire the logic necessary for developing high-quality programs. This book discusses control structures, functions, lists, and file I/O before introducing classes. As with all Gaddis texts, clear and easy-to-read code listings, concise and practical real-world examples, detail-oriented explanations, and an abundance of exercises appear in every chapter.\n\n \n\nThis book is ideal for a one-semester introductory programming course for students with limited programming experience.\n\n \n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n    * Control structures, functions, lists, and file I/O are covered before classes are introduced.\n    * A clear and student-friendly writing style simplifies programming processes for beginning programmers, with two to three stepped-out explanations following each major concept.\n    * A variety of exercises in each chapter encourages students to put concepts to work as they are learned. Source code is provided so that students can run the programs themselves.\n    * In the Spotlight case studies walk students through the design of a problem by showing all the important steps.\n    * Checkpoints check students' understanding of important lessons at key places in each chapter. Other student-friendly features include Concept, Note, Tip, and Warning boxes.\n    * A student resource CD-ROM packaged with each new text includes Python, the IDLE development environment, source code from the example problems, and answers to all Checkpoint question.\n\nCOMPATIBLE WITH OTHER BOOKS IN THE GADDIS SERIES\n\n \n\nTony Gaddis's best-selling Starting Out With series provides accessible, detailed presentations of programming concepts using an approach that will increase confidence and competence in novice programmers.\n\n \n\nThe Starting Out With series includes books that meet most course and teaching styles. Titles include Starting Out with Alice, Python, Visual BasicÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, C++, and JavaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢.\n\n \n\nVisit www.aw.com/gaddisbooks for more information.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n--This text refers to an alternate Paperback edition.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 648 pages\n    * Publisher: Addison Wesley; 2 edition (March 18, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0132576376\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0132576376","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd1a3222451ad6a46a27acb2540cc4039843ff0f","amp;dn":"Starting+Out+with+Python+%2C2nd+Edition%282011%29%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd1a3222451ad6a46a27acb2540cc4039843ff0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,26,50,34,69,26,214,164,106,39,172,178,84,12,196,3,152,67,255,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
