Only by the combination of all their skills can \n they hope to free Holmes and the kidnap victims, solve  \n the murders and prevent an audacious heist.             \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n            Jonathan Pryce ...
