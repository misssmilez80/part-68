As with other titles in the Biology of Habitats Series, the emphasis in the book is on the organisms that dominate this harsh environment, although theoretical and experimental aspects as well as conservation and desertification are also considered\n\nDeserts are defined by their arid conditions; a consequence of this aridity is that most of the area occupied by desert is barren and monotonous, leading many people to regard it as wasteland. However, deserts are widespread and represent surprisingly biodiverse environments, although it is the relative simplicity of these ecosystems that makes them more tractable for study than more complex environments. In these resource-poor locations, natural selection is working at its most extreme and provides some of the best-known examples of Darwinian selection.\n\nThe Biology of Deserts includes a wide range of ecological and evolutionary issues including morphological and physiological adaptations of desert plants and animals, species interactions, the importance of predation and parasitism, food webs, biodiversity and conservation. It features a balance of plant and animal (both invertebrate and vertebrate) examples, and also emphasizes topical applied issues such as desertification and invasive species. The book concludes by considering the positive aspects of desert conservation.\n\nEach of the books in the Oxford Biology of Habitats Series introduces a different habitat, and gives an integrated overview of the design, physiology, ecology, and behaviour of the organisms found there. The practical aspects of working within each habitat, the sorts of studies that are possible, and habitat biodiversity and conservation status are all explored.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 304 pages\n    * Publisher: Oxford University Press, USA (January 15, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0199211477\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0199211470","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf52366964e7b1b3c8900919c66d2c49dd89bfd4","amp;dn":"Biology+of+Deserts+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf52366964e7b1b3c8900919c66d2c49dd89bfd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,82,54,105,100,231,177,179,200,144,9,25,198,109,44,73,221,137,191,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
