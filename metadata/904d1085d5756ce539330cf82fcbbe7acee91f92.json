That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\n\nSome changes have been made to the previously announced makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are still possible. I plan on 12 more.  Approximate sizes listed based on what I have now. I still have duplicates and replacement scans to weed out and additions are possible. The big Batman one was popular so I'll do the same with Superman. The Superman torrent will be around 43-45gb, depending on how many replacement scans are in the folder now. I think it's a lot. I will not rush part 46, so as to give you all time to download.\n\nSizes given are the current size for the folder. Things may change.\n\n44 Superb-Swd (-Superman)  15gb\n45 Superman                45gb\n46 Swe-Td                  14gb\n47 Te-Tn                   15gb\n48 To-Unk                  15gb\n49 Unl-Waq                 16gb\n50 War-Wn                  18gb\n51 Wonder*                 14gb\n52 World*                  13gb\n53 Wo-Z (-Wonder, World)   17gb\n54 Fill Torent A-D         16gb\n55 Fill Torent E-Z         17gb\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering:  DC from Str-Supera\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nStrange Adventures v1 001-244 (1950-1973)\nStrange Adventures v2 01-04 (Vertigo(1999-2000)\nStrange Adventures v3 01-08 (2009)\nStrange Adventures v4 001 (2011)\n\nAn interesting attempt a genre blending.\nStrange Sports Stories 01-06 (1973-1974)\n\nStrange Suspense Stories v1=Captain Atom 75-77(Charlton(1965)\nStray (Homage(2001)\nStreet Code Chapter 1-6 p01-p60 (Zudacomics-DC Web(2008)\n\n\nStreet Fighter is not something I care about, but for those who do I have lots of Non-DC added in\n\nStreet Fighter (Malibu\nStreet Fighter 01-02 (1994)\nStreet Fighter 01-03 (1993)\n\nStreet Fighter (Udon\nStreet Fighter 01-14 (2003-2005)\nStreet Fighter II 00-06 (2005-2006)\nStreet Fighter II Turbo 01-12 (2008-2010)\nStreet Fighter IV 01-04 (2009)\nStreet Fighter IV Target Exclusive 001 (2009)\nStreet Fighter Legends-Chun Li 01-04 (2009)\nStreet Fighter Legends-Ibuki 01-04 (2010)\nStreet Fighter Legends-Sakura 01-04 (2006)\nStreet Fighter Remix 000 (2008)\n\nStreet Fighter v1 00-06 (Image(2003-2004)\n\nStreet Fighter-Battle for Shadaloo (DC-Capcom(1999)\n\nThe Street Fighter Magazine 001 (Capcom(02-20090\n\nStreets, because thats' so much cooler than &quot;Sidewalks&quot;\nStreets 01-03 (1993)\n\nThe DC TPB reprint of some of The Strontium Dog stories is unscanned,  So here's a lot more of him as a substitute and more.\n\nHaven't read it and I have no idea what the title is about. Is it a man nicknamed &quot;dog&quot;, and for some reason also called strontium? I have no idea. Is it a dog who likes to sniff out strontium ore? I could find out in  a moment but I'd rather go off on a tangent It's nearly inevitable that I will. &quot;Resistance is futile&quot;. It is.. my destiny. &quot;Destiny, Destiny, No escaping not for me!\n\nStrontium,  as every right thinking, God fearing, upstanding citizen of wherever you personally live knows, is an element. It is a silvery metal, soft and quite chemically active. In powdered form it oxidizes so rapidly it can burst in to flame  - this is what you call &quot;extreme rusting&quot;. It combines easily with  water too. So not going to be found in pure from in your back yard. If you have some though, it's valuable.\n\nIf the strontium dog here was a statue of a dog made of pure strontium - what would it be worth? Of course we must be more specific than &quot;dog&quot;, Well since it's a UK comic we'll take a 25kg English Bull Dog as our model.  That is obviously the breed that's most appropriate here symbolically. You can't get more appropriate than that. Apologies to the Scottish, Welsh and Irish in the UK, but  no West Highland Terriers, Scotch Terriers, Rough Collies,  Irish Wolfhounds, Irish Setters, Irish Spaniels, Welsh Corgies, Welsh Terriers, or Welsh Springer Spaniels need apply. \n\nSo  based on probably out of date and unreliable figures, our 25kg (55lb) English Bulldog statue of pure strontium is worth about $25,000 dollars, plus any value as an art object.\nNot too shabby!\n\nI know you were all as eager to know that as I was. Surely your minds are curious about everything in the universe like mine is? In my head, I know that's probably not true of many of you, but I can't wrap my head around it.  Which is a very odd idiom to use in this case. In my heart I know it's true. I have a gut feeling about it.  I feel it in my bones. Deep in my soul, in my bowels, in the very fiber of my being. This would have been killer if I could have  figured out how to work &quot;spleen&quot; in here. Darn! I really am upset about it. I really just need to vent my spleen about this.

There are maybe a dozen or so scattered around the US. I have not heard of anyone doing this as a crook. Sure, there are robbers who have worn costumes as a disguise while robbing a store. For some reason they were not content with the just a mask. But these were just one-offs, not an attempt to create a persona. They don't make new custom Super-Villian costumes and make up Super-Villian names. This might be because this would be an incredibly stupid thing to do. The last thing a criminal should want to do is attract extra attention and tie themselves to additional crimes by wearing a signature costume. Even the one offs are idiots, since they are far more noticeable arriving and departing.  But if you know of a case of super-villany I'd love to hear about it. Real criminals are not nearly as entertaining as they could be.\n\nSuper Heroes-Prisoners of the Stars (Promo)\n\nSuper Powers v1 01-05 (1984)\nSuper Powers v2 01-06 (1985-1986)\nSuper Powers v3 01-04 (1986)\n\nSuper Powers Collection 01-23 Kenner Promo (1984-1984)\nSuper Powers Collection 001-Superman Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 002-Batman Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 003-Wonder Woman Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 004-The Flash Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 005-Brainiac Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 006-The Penguin Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 007-The Joker Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 008-Aquaman Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 009-Robin Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 010-Lex Luthor Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 011-Green Lantern Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 012-Hawkman Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 013-Steppenwolf Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 014-Martian Manhunter Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 015-Doctor Fate Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 016-Firestorm Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 017-Mantis Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 018-Green Arrow Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 019-Darkseid Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 020-Kalibak Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 021-Desaad Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 022-Parademon Mini Comic\nSuper Powers Collection 023-Red Tornado Mini Comic\n\nAmalgam-A DC-Marvel project\nSuper Soldier (04-1996)\nSuper Soldier-Man of War (06-1997)\n\nSuper Tron Season p01-p120 (Zudacomics-DC Web(2008-2010)\n\nWhat could be better than super gorillas?
