I applied the crack to the EXE already, and originally this only works on XP.\n\nThe unique thing about this version is I have made it work with Windows 7 as well.\nOn Windows 7, it will give a notification about something on start, but otherwise this program is good to go.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1) Download\n2) Run the program! Already cracked =)\n\nI have included 6 runs of my cammed LT1/T56 vehicle that were recorded using the NEWEST version of datmaaster EE just for reference. I was curious to see if it really read them with this older version.\n\nFeel free to read the note to the developers.\n\nIf you are a developer, no hard feelings. I just don't agree with what you are doing to people.\n\nThis is untested as of now. I have only started the program on xp/7, and have not tried datalogging yet. Let me know if there are any issues.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33421bacc36bf28aa9a092afb796e81f04290184","amp;dn":"Datamaster+EE+v3.4.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33421bacc36bf28aa9a092afb796e81f04290184","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,66,27,172,195,107,242,138,169,160,146,175,183,150,232,31,4,41,1,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
