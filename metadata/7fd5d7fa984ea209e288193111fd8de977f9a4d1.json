The      \n  first film in this three-part series looks at a history of domestic   \n  pottery in Britain from Tudor times onwards, tracing the evolution    \n  of its different techniques and styles, and examining what our pots   \n  can tell us in intimate detail how preceeding generations lived and   \n  saw themselves.                                                       \n                                                                        \n  Whether it's for celebrating birth, marriage and death (our own or    \n  royal), eating and drinking or showing the world our social status,   \n  ceramics contain more than just our tea or coffee - they contain      \n  something of our lives, our social DNA, and reveal a lot about our    \n  taste and habits as a nation. They become, in effect, snapshots in    \n  clay.                                                                 \n                                                                        \n  Contributors include David Attenborough, Edmund de Waal, Grayson      \n  Perry, Lucy Worsley, Mary Wondrausch and Elspeth Owen.                \n                                                                        \n  Enjoy this look at historic Britain!                                  \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fb8ccf9d98899e8cbb9c969a9297d5989496&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fd5d7fa984ea209e288193111fd8de977f9a4d1","amp;dn":"Ceramics.A.Fragile.History.Part.1.WEBRip.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fd5d7fa984ea209e288193111fd8de977f9a4d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,213,215,250,152,78,162,9,226,136,25,49,17,253,141,233,119,249,164,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
