His laboratory alone offers a screen-filling array of 3-D props and gimmicks, not least of them the vampy Elvira, who plays herself. The film's shifting between plain old Elvira and Elvira with 3-D cleavage is only one of the ways it has fun with its medium.\n\n&quot;Encounter in the Third Dimension&quot; reviews the history of 3-D, from the Lumiere brothers' oncoming train to a bit by Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, with a set of clips that have been enterprisingly arranged.\n\nThe real standout here is the elaborate roller coaster fantasy that hurls the audience into gravity-defying races through seemingly huge settings. What begins in an Indiana Jones-type underground cavern takes the viewer under the sea and up toward the stars, in sequences that are as imaginatively staged as they are vertiginous. The excitement is offset by the deliberate cheesiness of the professor's merry shtick.\n\nYoung children overheard at one preview of &quot;Encounter in the Third Dimension&quot; said it was fun, and it is. \n\n\nImage : http://www.stereo3d.com/img/dvdencounter_hi.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dce428bcf06ba9b115729e15ca1e24f339b8d4b4","amp;dn":"Encounter+in+the+third+dimension","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dce428bcf06ba9b115729e15ca1e24f339b8d4b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,228,40,188,240,107,169,177,21,114,158,21,202,30,36,243,57,184,212,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
