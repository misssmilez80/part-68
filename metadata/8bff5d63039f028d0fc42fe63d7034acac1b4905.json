With 4.1.1.0, we increased the amount of unique device profiles to over 1000 !\n\nNew in this release of DVD Catalyst 4 are profiles for the Galaxy Nexus, Transformer Prime, Kindle Fire, A100, Droid Razr and many more. We even added specific Ice Cream Sandwich profiles for devices currently in development. But, in the small chance that your particular device is not listed, just contact us, and we will suggest the best settings for your device, and include profiles for it in the next update.\n\n* New conversion formats:\nIf you are a DVD Catalyst ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPower UserÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, its time to get really excited. In this version, we included a large collection of new High Quality conversion formats that will knock your socks off. Available in AVI, MKV, Mp4 and MV4 containers, you can convert your movies using H264 or XVID video codecs along with a choice of AC3, AAC or MP3 audio. Started as a request to provide a format that would use hardware acceleration for video but not for audio using Dice Player on Android Tablets, we tweaked these settings for a considerable amount of time to make sure they produce the best possible quality even on smaller file-sizes.\n\n* New Quality Profiles for popular devices:\nWith the new High Quality conversion formats added, we also implemented a new quality profile (next to the fast, standard, hq1 and hq2 ones), but rather than just having it create larger files and call it HQ3, we decided that it would be more useful to create a profile that could work great for DVD-sized content as well as HD (720p) content. Right now, for most devices, we recommend using the standard profile for DVDs, and for HD content either HQ1 (slower movies) or HQ2 (action movies), but with the new HQXT (High Quality eXTreme) profile, you can get a great quality using just the one profile. For DVDs, the filesize goes up a little, however, if you are used to converting HD content using the HQ profiles, you will find that you can shave off quite a bit of size while still having a great-looking video. Especially if you convert a mixture of different-sized content, the HQXT profiles will be a great choice for your conversions.\n\n* Log:\nOriginally introduced in DVD Catalyst 4.1, but due to some complications with that release set aside, in 4.1.1.0, we reimplemented the log. While it does not provide much detailed information yet, it does provide some help with troubleshooting. It will get better in the next update though. To open the log, tap on Help &gt; View Log in the top menu of DVD Catalyst 4.\n\n* More:\n\nIn addition to the new stuff above, we also reimplemented the Internet Proxy Settings in Global Settings to make it easier to check for updates for some people, also the 5.1 audio has been worked on for the people who use DVD Catalyst 4 for their HD Media Player (WDTV, Popcornhour etc). Also work-around for many tricky DVDs such as Transformers 3, The Fighter, Thor and more have been implemented so for most people these DVDs will work without having to select the proper track.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n*** When using TPB please read these important notes: \n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6487418&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6487418&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11. In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13. Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n14. Comments are welcome, unlike ranting, trolling, whining, etc.\n\n15. No Promises ... No Debts!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents                                               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor my 1250+ torrents                                               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally \nposting fake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\t\t\n\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bff5d63039f028d0fc42fe63d7034acac1b4905","amp;dn":"DVD.Catalyst.4.v4.1.1.RETAIL-TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bff5d63039f028d0fc42fe63d7034acac1b4905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,255,93,99,3,159,2,141,15,196,47,230,61,112,52,172,172,27,73,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
