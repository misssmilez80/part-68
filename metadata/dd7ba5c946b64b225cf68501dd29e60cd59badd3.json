This has made it necessary to disseminate knowledge to a large audience of interest. The book addresses this need by informing the reader about the complex worldwide use of spice plants.\n\nThe many spice and aromatic plants are arranged in alphabetical order of their botanical relevance. It includes all species which have been cultivated for the above purposes. It also covers species whose usage has long ceased or which are used only rarely or have become wild. In this respect the author has aimed at comprehensiveness. In total over 1400 plants have been collated.\n\nThe very extensive register of literature has been designed to facilitate intensive study of a specific plant or spice. Works both on botany and agriculture, and on chemistry, pharmacodynamics and usage have been considered.\n\nThe book is aimed principally at spice and aroma experts, pharmacists, botanists and interested lay persons. But the author also had in mind food chemists, dieticians and agricultural scientists, for whom botany, chemistry and pharmacological aspects may be of interest. It is hoped that those occupied in the spice and aroma industry involved in creating spice blends and the like will also take inspiration from the book.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 592 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (July 21, 2005)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3540222790\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3540222798\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd7ba5c946b64b225cf68501dd29e60cd59badd3","amp;dn":"World+Spice+Plants+-+Economic+Usage%2C+Botany+and+Taxonomy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd7ba5c946b64b225cf68501dd29e60cd59badd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,123,165,201,70,182,75,34,92,246,133,1,221,41,230,12,213,155,173,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
