Yes this IS real. Comes with all 225 episodes, catagorized by season, and the best quality possible for this series. I hope you all enjoy this 1950's classic hit.\n\nThis old black and white series features the classy, styled, ex West Point graduate/ soldier -now gunslinger by the name of Paladin. Whom at a base charge of $1,000 sets out from his comfy home in San Francisco's Carlton Hotel to solve any problem worthy of his 'special' expertise. With a firm conviction of morals, beliefs, and abilities, and a profound knowledge of history, literature and philosophy (not to mention his custom-made .45 caliber Colt Single Action Army revolver) Paladin helps bring order and culture to the very wild west of the late 1800's.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:924f9ff82b8669ccbdf0b48f78c90b4f65b9af4c","amp;dn":"Have+Gun+Will+Travel++%28The+Complete+Collector%5C%27s+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"924f9ff82b8669ccbdf0b48f78c90b4f65b9af4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,79,159,248,43,134,105,204,189,240,180,143,120,201,11,79,101,185,175,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
