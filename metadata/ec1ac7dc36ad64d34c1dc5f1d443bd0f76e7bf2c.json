In &quot;HISTORY'S RAIDERS&quot; some of the most exciting and decisive small unit actions have been minutely researched and uncovered with unprecedented access to over 500,000 hours of archive film, much of which will be seen in the series for the first time. \n\nProduced by Nugus / Martin Productions Ltd for the History Channel MMI\n\n\n\n\nEpisode 14 : Human Torpedo Raiders\n\nOne of the most remarkable raiding weapons of World War 2 was the Italian Maiale human torpedo. On the night of December 18th, 1941, three of them fundamentally changed the balance of naval power by crippling the only British battleships remaining in the Eastern Mediterranean. This triumph was soon being copied as the British, Germans, and Japanese developed their own human torpedoes.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2267 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 44:46.411\nNumber Of Parts: 26\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec1ac7dc36ad64d34c1dc5f1d443bd0f76e7bf2c","amp;dn":"HC.History%27s.Raiders.14of26.Human.Torpedo.Raiders.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec1ac7dc36ad64d34c1dc5f1d443bd0f76e7bf2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,26,199,220,54,173,100,211,76,29,197,241,212,67,189,15,118,231,191,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
