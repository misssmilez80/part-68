We start counting our fingers and toes and end up balancing checkbooks and calculating risk. So powerful is the appeal of numbers that many people ascribe to them a mystical significance. Other numbers go beyond the supernatural, working to explain our universe and how it behaves. In Cosmic Numbers, mathematics professor James D. Stein traces the discovery, evolution, and interrelationships of the numbers that define our world. Everyone knows about the speed of light and absolute zero, but numbers like BoltzmannÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s constant and the Chandrasekhar limit are not as well known, and they do far more than one might imagine: They tell us how this world began and what the future holds. Much more than a gee-whiz collection of facts and figures, Cosmic Numbers illuminates why particular numbers are so importantboth to the scientist and to the rest of us.\n\nBasic Books 2011\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea7129fb54a10c17b217fa4fb0164829c379376e","amp;dn":"Cosmic+Numbers%3A++The+Numbers+That+Define+Our+Universe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea7129fb54a10c17b217fa4fb0164829c379376e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,113,41,251,84,161,12,23,178,23,250,79,176,22,72,41,195,121,55,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
