The film is based on the 1956 short story \\&quot;Steel\\&quot; by Richard Matheson, though Levy placed the film in U.S. state fairs and other \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; Americana settings. Real Steel was in development for several years before production began in June of 2010. Filming took place primarily in the U.S. state of Michigan. Animatronic robots were built for the film, and motion capture technology was used to depict the brawling of computer-generated robots. Real Steel was publicly released in Australia on October 6, 2011 and in the United States and Canada on October 7, 2011. It will be in both conventional and IMAX theaters.\n\n\n\n* Plot :\n \nIn 2020, humans have been replaced by robots in boxing. Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a former boxer who attempts to get money in illegal boxing matches between robots to pay his debts to loan sharks. During a fight, Charlie\\'s robot, Ambush, is destroyed by Black Thunder, a bull belonging to Ricky (Kevin Durand). Having made a bet that Ambush would win, Charlie now owes Ricky $20,000, which he doesn\\'t pay before leaving.\n \nWhile leaving, Charlie is informed that his ex-girlfriend has died, and he has to attend a meeting to decide the fate of his 11-year-old son Max (Dakota Goyo). Max\\'s aunt Debra (Hope Davis) and uncle Marvin (James Rebhorn) want full custody, and Charlie gives it to them in exchange for $100,000 from Marvin, $50,000 of in advance, on the condition that Charlie takes care of Max for three months, while Marvin and Debra are away on a second honeymoon.\n \nCharlie and Max meet with Charlie\\'s friend Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lily), who runs the boxing gym of her deceased father, Charlie\\'s old coach. There, Charlie buys a secondhand Japanese robot, Noisy Boy, and arranges for it to fight the illegal circuit\\'s champion, Midas, at a venue belonging to his friend Finn (Anthony Mackie). Partly due to his inexperience with the robot, Charlie ends up losing control of Noisy Boy and Midas destroys it.\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGLOBE FILES 2011\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5f203296ddb6f27d4f9b9cd15072450254c79db","amp;dn":"REAL+STEEL+RMVB+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5f203296ddb6f27d4f9b9cd15072450254c79db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,242,3,41,109,219,111,39,212,249,185,205,21,7,36,80,37,76,121,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
