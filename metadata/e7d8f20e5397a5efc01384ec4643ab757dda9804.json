What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 10 - Monday - Celebrate pizza and pasta with a super-sized challenge. The four best cooks from the previous challenge compete against each other for the chance to cook off for an Immunity Pin. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7d8f20e5397a5efc01384ec4643ab757dda9804","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E56.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7d8f20e5397a5efc01384ec4643ab757dda9804","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,216,242,14,83,151,165,239,192,19,132,236,70,67,171,117,125,218,152,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
