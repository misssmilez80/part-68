That is the essence of Happy Jazz.\nSwing &amp; Dixie is Happy Jazz at its best. With a perfect blend of old time Swing and Dixieland jazz-standards, the band has earned a reputation of creating an atmosphere of warmth, humour, joyful grins and intense stomping feet wherever they perform.\nYou will catch a glimpse of the club atmosphere in the first seven songs that were recorded at the Falu Jazzclub.\nThe oldtimers, Arne, Hasse, Rolf and Lennart, with long experience from numerous bands, including Sandviken Big Band (which they founded), combined with fresh blood from the youngsters (Niklas and Geir), make a perfect mix of traditional, solid, back-beat and young, modern attitude.\nSit back, make room for your stomping feet and enjoy music from the happy days\n\n\n- - -\n\nSwing &amp; Dixie - Happy Days 2001\n(Sandviken Holmen Music)\n\n 1.
