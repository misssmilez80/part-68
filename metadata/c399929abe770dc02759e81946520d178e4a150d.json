In some ways yes, but there's a lot of economics and politics to wade through first.\n\n\nWhen Humankind returns to the Moon, this time the plan is to mine its surface for hidden resources. Elements like hydrogen and oxygen, trapped in the lunar soil, are the keys to a permanent colony and for future missions to Mars and beyond. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by : James Lurie\n=========================\n\n\nDirected by: Rob Beemer\n=======================\n\n\n\nWritten &amp; Produced by: Rebecca Graham Forde\n===========================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Mining The Moon\nYear.................:    2008\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:43:54\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    130 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    512x288\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1116 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    350 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           ***  RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click \n\non DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s) \n\ninstead,thank you.\t\t          ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c399929abe770dc02759e81946520d178e4a150d","amp;dn":"Mining+The+Moon-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c399929abe770dc02759e81946520d178e4a150d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,153,146,154,190,119,13,192,39,89,232,25,70,82,13,23,142,74,21,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
