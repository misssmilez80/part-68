He writes his best songs whenever he doesnt try to tackle big issues, meaning the heady ballads miss the mark while the zippy, happy-go-lucky numbers - including Amy, I and the propulsive opener, My Racing Thoughts - deliver the biggest melodic punch. McMahons recovery from leukemia has left him introspective, but his roots are in Something Corporates buoyant, punky pop, which leaves People and Things stuck between two extremes. Whenever the tempo picks up, the album delivers an adult version of the West Coast pop anthems McMahon has been writing since his teens. Whenever it slows down, as it does on Hey Hey Hey (Were All Gonna Die), the breezy appeal flies out the window. If anyone deserves the right to ruminate a bit, though, it is McMahon, who spins his illness into rich, metaphor-heavy lyrics that rarely wallow. People and Things might not be as accessible as Everything in Transit, which contained some of the brightest pop songs of McMahon's career, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stronger than The Glass Passenger, indicating that McMahon has begun to move onward and upward.\n\nReleased: October 4, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Alternative\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~1,000 kbps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
