Join the experts who will take you closer to solving one of the world's greatest mysteries in Finding Atlantis.\n\nFor thousands of years the legend of Atlantis has fascinated humanity. From the ancient Greeks to Columbus to the Nazis, many have sought out this fantastical city. But, despite the best efforts of generations of adventurers, archaeologists and explorers, no one has ever managed to determine its whereabouts or even if it actually existed.\n\nIn Finding Atlantis, join a team of archaeologists, geologists, divers and dreamers, who believe that they have located the site of this most famous city of ancient times. As the team deploys the latest techniques - including satellite imaging, sonar and ground-penetrating radar to explore their theories, they take to the sea and air of southern Spain in search of the truth.\n\nCould some dusty ruins and a gigantic marsh really signal the final resting place of this once-mighty civilisation?\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Ted Marcoux  \n========================\n\n\n\nDirected by: Graeme Ball\n========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Finding Atlantis\nYear.................:    2011\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:44:49\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)  \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    640x480\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2201 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (External English) \nFile Size:...........:    721 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2011 \n\n\n\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1864327/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1864327/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1864327/synopsis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1864327/synopsis&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae6bd0e407daae4b0ed43cd75ca484e34f1a5f6e","amp;dn":"Finding+Atlantis-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae6bd0e407daae4b0ed43cd75ca484e34f1a5f6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,107,208,228,7,218,174,75,14,212,60,215,92,164,132,227,79,26,95,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
