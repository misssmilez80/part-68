Their works have been cited as influences by such hip acts as Grandaddy and Super Furry Animals. Their frontman and leader Jeff Lynne has been the producer of choice for people likePaul McCartney, Tom Petty and George Harrison. From &quot;Evil Woman&quot;, &quot;Don't Bring Me Down&quot; and &quot;Mr Blue Sky&quot; to &quot;Livin' Thing&quot; and &quot;Hold On Tight&quot;, there are few duds amongst these 20\nremastered tracks. ELO produced some of the biggest and best singles in rock &amp; roll's history, and All Over The World: The Very Best Of ELO is an excellent reintroduction to this great band. Hopefully, this also signals the beginning of a long-overdue revival and re-evaluation. --Robert Burrow\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Mr. blue sky                                         [05:05]\n02.Evil woman                                           [04:13]\n03.Don't bring me down                                  [04:05]\n04.Sweet talkin' woman                                  [03:50]\n05.Shine A little love                                  [04:13]\n06.Turn to stone                                        [03:50]\n07.The diary of horace wimp                             [04:18]\n08.Confusion                                            [03:42]\n09.Hold on tight                                        [03:07]\n10.Livin' thing                                         [03:33]\n11.Telephone line                                       [04:42]\n12.All over the world                                   [04:05]\n13.Wild west hero                                       [04:43]\n14.Showdown                                             [04:10]\n15.Ma-Ma-ma belle                                       [03:39]\n16.Xanadu                                               [03:22]\n17.Rockaria!
