Andrew was a member of the bands L'ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tranger and Ursula, and a solo artist, and Peter was a member of Skydiggers. Although their careers were closely connected (Skydiggers, in fact, often played as Andrew's backing band at the Spadina Hotel), they never wrote or performed together as a duo.\n\nIn 1996, however, the brothers both left their previous bands, and started writing and performing as a duo. Their debut album as The Cash Brothers, Raceway, was released in 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cash Brothers - How Was Tomorrow 2001\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nRaceway\nTake A Little Time\nNebraska\nThe Only One\nNerve\nShow Me The Reason\nNight Shift Guru\nGuitar Strings and Foolish Things\nAwkward Game\nI Am Waiting\nDream Awake\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b700634143cb6ff7c7d14b1f5c6735ea9994a0","amp;dn":"The+Cash+Brothers+-+How+Was+Tomorrow+2001+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b700634143cb6ff7c7d14b1f5c6735ea9994a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,183,0,99,65,67,203,111,247,199,209,75,31,92,103,53,234,153,148,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
