Local newsman Adam Carlson (Krasinski) can't wait to escape the northern tip of Alaska for a bigger market. But just when the story of his career breaks, the world comes chasing it, too. With an oil tycoon, heads of state and hungry journalists descending upon the frigid outpost, the one who worries Adam the most is Rachel Kramer (Barrymore). Not only is she an outspoken environmentalist, she's also his ex-girlfriend. With time running out, Rachel and Adam must rally an unlikely coalition of Inuit natives, oil companies and Russian and American military to set aside their differences and free the whales. As the world's attention turns to the top of the globe, saving these endangered animals becomes a shared cause for nations entrenched against one another and leads to a momentary thaw in the Cold War. \n\nGenre: Drama, Romance\n\nDirector: Ken Kwapis\n\nCast: Drew Barrymore, John Krasinski, Kristen Bell, Dermot Mulroney, Tim Blake Nelson, Ted Danson\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nVideo: Xvid 1920x816 23.98fps\n\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 320kbps\n___________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b17500e2a18f632b9f6ab3a4a44f580810e50b5e","amp;dn":"Big+Miracle.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%5BHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b17500e2a18f632b9f6ab3a4a44f580810e50b5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,117,0,226,161,143,99,43,159,106,179,164,164,79,88,8,16,229,11,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
