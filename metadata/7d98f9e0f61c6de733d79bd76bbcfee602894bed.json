It will f*ck the player model.\n# I recommend not starting a new game. If you wanna play the missions use \\\\\\&quot;CTRL + M\\\\\\&quot; for choosing any mission.\n# Most sounds of heavy, sniper, pyro and spy are changed but in some moments you might hear their real voice (haven\\\\\\'t find all sounds).\nIf you have slow pc disable the ENB series before loading or starting game by pressing LShift + F12 \n\nIf you find some bug or have problems (except low PCs) contact me: (Sry for my English)\n\n-----Email: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e3a4ac87bcafd288d0a3828195cd8184&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n-----Skype: weather_storm1\n-----Telephone:  some other time :p","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d98f9e0f61c6de733d79bd76bbcfee602894bed","amp;dn":"GTA+San+Andreas+Team+Fortress","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d98f9e0f61c6de733d79bd76bbcfee602894bed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,152,249,224,246,28,109,231,51,215,155,215,107,188,254,230,2,137,75,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
