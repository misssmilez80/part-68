In the year 2149, the world is dying. The planet is overdeveloped and overcrowded, with the majority of plant and animal life extinct. The future of mankind is in jeopardy, and its only hope for survival is in the distant past.\n\nWhen scientists unexpectedly discovered a fracture in time that made it possible to construct a portal into primeval history, the bold notion was born to resettle humanity in the past ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a second chance to rebuild civilization and get it right this time.\n\nThe series centers on the Shannon family as they join the Tenth Pilgrimage of settlers to Terra Nova, the first colony established in this beautiful yet foreboding land. JIM SHANNON (Jason OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Mara), a devoted father with a checkered past, guides his family through this new world of limitless beauty, mystery and terror. JimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wife, ELISABETH (Shelley Conn), is a trauma surgeon and the newest addition to Terra NovaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s medical team. JOSH (Landon Liboiron) is their 17-year-old son who is torn to leave life as he knows it behind; upon arriving at the settlement, he finds himself instantly drawn to the beautiful and rule-breaking SKYE (Allison Miller). MADDY (Naomi Scott), JoshÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s endearingly awkward 15-year-old sister, hopes Terra Nova will give her a chance to reinvent herself. Although ElisabethÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s medical training secured the family a spot on the pilgrimage, a secret involving their five-year-old daughter, ZOE (Alana Mansour), soon endangers their place in this utopia.\n\n&quot;The future of mankind is in jeopardy, and its only hope for survival is in the distant past.&quot;\nUpon the ShannonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ arrival, they are introduced to COMMANDER NATHANIEL TAYLOR (Stephen Lang), the charismatic and heroic first pioneer and leader of the settlement. Taylor warns the travelers that while Terra Nova is a place of new opportunities and fresh beginnings, all is not as idyllic as it initially appears. Along with blue skies, towering waterfalls and lush vegetation, the surrounding terrain is teeming with danger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and not just of the man-eating dinosaur variety. There is also a splinter colony of renegades led by the battle-hardened MIRA (Christine Adams), who is vehemently opposed to Taylor and his leadership.\n\nEven more threatening than what lies outside the protective walls of the colony is the chilling possibility that something sinister is happening inside Terra Nova. The Shannons will come to suspect that not everyone on this mission has the same idea of how to best save mankind; in fact, there may be forces intent on destroying this new world before it even begins.\n\nTERRA NOVA is produced by 20th Century Fox Television, Chernin Entertainment, DreamWorks Television and Kapital Entertainment.
