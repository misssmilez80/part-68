Blues Medley\n\n\nAllow me to introduce you to one of &quot;those&quot; players. You know the one that you have never heard of, but should? Bobby is a talented leap frog of a guitar player. He's also one heck of a singer. Bobby is a bluesman aged to perfection.\n\n13 tracks fill your ears on this release. From the title track's searing vocals, to the rockabilly, blues style of &quot;Spanky's Twist&quot;...the album starts off strong and ends strong as well. &quot;Blues Medley&quot; the last track on this album is pure blues perfection.\n\nHere is a man who loves what he does. If you are looking for a bluesy, rock guitar man peppered with funk, look no more. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf105b67e847591f11f41c4be7590bbe4c3af3c2","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Bobby+Radcliff+-+There%5C%27s+A+Cold+Grave+In+Your+Way","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf105b67e847591f11f41c4be7590bbe4c3af3c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,16,91,103,232,71,89,31,17,244,28,75,231,89,11,190,76,58,243,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
