The comedy of the novel revolves around his attempts to understand English as it was spoken in Australia by the working classes in the 1950s and 1960s. Nino had previously only learned 'good' English from a textbook.\n\nThe novel is a social commentary on Australian society of the period; specifically male, working class society. Women mostly feature as cameos in the story with the exception of Kay (whose surname is not revealed in the novel), who becomes Nino's wife. In the novel, Nino meets Kay in a cafe in Manly and their introduction is effected by Nino trying to teach Kay that she cannot eat spaghetti using a spoon.\n\nThe final message of the novel is that immigrants to Australia should count themselves fortunate and should make efforts to assimilate into Australian society, including learning to speak Australian English. However, there is also a satirical undercurrent aimed at Australian society as a country of migrants.\n\n        \n\n              1966        112 mins         Comedy        35mm Colour      \n\n                   Optical Soundtrack: Mono      Rated G\n\n \n\nDirector:                Michael Powell\n\nProduction Company:      Williamson-Powell International Films\n\nProducer:                Michael Powell\n\nAssociate Producer:      John Pellatt\n\nUnit Manager:            Bruce Bennett\n\nScriptwriter:            John Imrie (Emeric Pressburger).

The record run at the State Theatre in Sydney was in 1989 still unbeaten\n\n                 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c3c91c935ae194ec7e48d1cf6200db8fe1d0f6a","amp;dn":"They%5C%27re+a+Weird+Mob+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c3c91c935ae194ec7e48d1cf6200db8fe1d0f6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,60,145,201,53,174,25,78,199,228,141,28,246,32,13,184,254,29,15,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
