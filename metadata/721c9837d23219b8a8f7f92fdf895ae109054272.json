Comic actor Robert Wuhl, who created and stars, plays Arliss Michaels, a sports super-agent driven by twin motivations of profit and idealism. Arliss is in the race to realize his clients\\' dreams of stupendous wealth, but he\\'s just as likely to put his reputation (and big bucks) on the line to help a fading player claim his niche in history. As with HBO\\'s The Larry Sanders Show, Arli$$ gets a lot of mileage out of verisimilitude. In these Best of shows, we meet the likes of Dave Winfield, Ernie Banks, Frank Deford, Lloyd Jones, Tommy Lasorda, and even O.J. attorney Bob Shapiro, playing themselves in some very funny stories about the perennial hopes and startling realities that drive professional sports. --Tom Keogh\n\nProduct Description\nIt\\'s tough being a professional athlete. Sure, there are big bucks. And big time glory. But there\\'s also responsibility. Temptations. The media. Hangers on. More temptation. Diminishing skills. Lost endorsements. An uncertain future. Still more temptations. In the fast lane of pro sports, an athlete needs someone he can trust. He needs a friend. An adviser. A big brother. Todays sports superstar needs more than just an agent, he needs a super agent. He needs Arliss. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Best-Arli-Sports-Super-Agent/dp/B00008WJBD/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Best-Arli-Sports-Super-Agent/dp/B00008WJBD/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:721c9837d23219b8a8f7f92fdf895ae109054272","amp;dn":"The+Best+of+Arliss+%28Arli%24%24%29%3A+The+Art+of+the+Sports+Super+Agent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"721c9837d23219b8a8f7f92fdf895ae109054272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,28,152,55,210,50,25,184,168,247,249,47,223,137,90,225,9,5,66,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
