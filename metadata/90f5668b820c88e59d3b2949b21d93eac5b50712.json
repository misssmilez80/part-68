Based on the wildly successful Angry Birds, Angry Birds Rio was released for devices using Apple's iOS, Google's Android and Mac OS X in March 2011.[1] The game was released as a marketing tie-in with the 20th Century Fox animated film Rio, and was promoted along with the movie.[2] While utilizing the same basic gameplay as the original game, Angry Birds Rio added a number of new elements, most notably the first use of boss levels. The game is consistently one of the top downloaded applications on both the App Store and the Android Market.\n\nIn Rio, the familiar Angry Birds have been kidnapped and taken to Rio de Janeiro.[1] Just as in the original Angry Birds, players use a slingshot to launch birds at nearby structures, with the intent of hitting targets located on or within them. Instead of evil pigs that have stolen eggs, players must now rescue caged exotic birds or defeat evil marmosets, depending on the level being played. Certain levels allow players to use Blu and Jewel, the two lead characters from Rio. The game also includes the first boss fights to appear in the series, when the player uses the birds to attack Nigel, the main antagonist from the film,[3] as well as new hidden items to collect as the player progresses through the game.[4]\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n\nTo play the Angry Birds on a PC with Windows XP and Windows 7 requires the following requirements:\n- Operating System: Windows Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP / Vista / Windows Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7\n- Processor: 2GHz\n- Memory: 512 MB\n- Video: 3D-graphics card compatible with DirectX, 128 MB\n- Sound Card: Sound device compatible with DirectX Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c\n- Free space on hard disk: 45.2 MB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90f5668b820c88e59d3b2949b21d93eac5b50712","amp;dn":"Angry+Birds+Rio+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90f5668b820c88e59d3b2949b21d93eac5b50712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,245,102,139,130,12,136,229,157,59,41,73,178,29,147,234,197,181,7,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
